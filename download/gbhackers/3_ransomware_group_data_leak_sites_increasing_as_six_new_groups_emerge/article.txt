The cybersecurity landscape has witnessed a significant uptick in ransomware activity, with six new data-leak sites (DLSs) linked to emerging ransomware groups identified in early 2025.

According to Cyjax, these groups include Kraken, Morpheus, GD LockerSec, Babuk2, Linkc, and the newly surfaced Anubis.

The latter operates as a sophisticated Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) entity, offering affiliates tools for data extortion and monetization of unauthorized access.

Anubis stands out for its professional-grade infrastructure and operational strategy.

Its DLS currently lists four victims across the United States, Peru, and Australia.

Notably, one victim, First Defense Fire Protection (FDFP), has publicly confirmed a data breach.

The group uses its DLS to publish stolen data progressively, leveraging this tactic to pressure victims into paying ransoms.

Anubis’ operations reflect a calculated approach to targeting organizations in regions such as the US, Europe, Canada, and Australia while avoiding entities in ex-USSR and BRICS nations.

The group explicitly excludes sectors like education, government, and non-profits from its attacks.

Its DLS provides detailed analyses of leaked data, including sensitive personal information (“fullz”), internal documents, and financial details.

The group’s presence extends beyond its DLS to cybercriminal forums and social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where it advertises its activities and engages with affiliates.

Anubis has also introduced an affiliate program featuring ransomware binaries with advanced capabilities such as cross-platform functionality, anti-defense mechanisms, and privilege escalation.

Affiliates can partner with the group under revenue-sharing models that range from 50-50 for initial access monetization to 80-20 for ransomware operations.

Escalating Threats in 2025

The emergence of these six new ransomware groups highlights the growing sophistication of cybercriminal networks.

In 2024 alone, Cyjax tracked 72 extortion-related DLSs, a number that continues to rise in 2025.

These platforms are central to modern ransomware operations, enabling threat actors to publicize stolen data and escalate pressure on victims through staged disclosures.

Anubis’ DLS is particularly notable for its seamless functionality and strategic design.

It features sections like “News,” “FAQ,” “About,” and “Rules,” offering insights into its operations and methods for victims or affiliates to engage with the group.

Unlike many other extortion groups, Anubis does not impose countdowns for data release but instead relies on detailed leaks to amplify its impact.

The group’s activities underscore the persistent threat posed by RaaS models that empower even less-skilled attackers to execute sophisticated campaigns.

With one confirmed breach and three additional victims yet to respond publicly, Anubis is likely to remain active in the coming months as it expands its operations and partnerships within the cybercriminal ecosystem.

As ransomware groups continue to evolve their tactics and infrastructure, organizations must remain vigilant against these threats by strengthening their cybersecurity defenses and incident response capabilities.
