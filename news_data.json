        "content": "날짜: May 21, 2025\n\n요약: Patching is basic cyber hygiene — but executing it at scale, securely, and fast? That's the real challenge. ThreatLocker's Patch Management flips the script with control, visibility, and Zero Trust workflows built for today's threat landscape.\n\n본문:\nPatching vulnerabilities is one of the most basic principles of cybersecurity — and one of the hardest to execute consistently and securely at scale.\n\nIn today’s threat landscape, adversaries routinely exploit vulnerabilities within hours of public disclosure. Yet, operational constraints, patch instability, and incomplete visibility into assets make it almost impossible for many organizations to patch fast enough without introducing new risks.\n\nThreatLocker Patch Management is built to tackle this reality head-on, providing security teams with greater control, visibility, and confidence over patching workflows — without compromising the stability of production systems.\n\nFor most organizations, patching is treated as a race against time. As soon as a critical CVE drops — whether it’s another Microsoft Exchange zero-day (think ProxyShell, CVE-2021-34473) or a remote code execution bug in Chrome — IT scrambles to deploy vendor patches as fast as possible.\n\nBut patching under pressure often introduces its own risks:\n\nIn fact, according to the 2023 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities (CISA), many breaches traced back to vulnerabilities that had patches available for months, or even years — a clear sign that it's not awareness that's lacking, but execution.\n\nEven fully patched apps can be exploited.\n\nThreatLocker Ringfencing™ controls what approved applications can access—like files, scripts, or the internet—stopping living-off-the-land attacks and preventing lateral movement before it starts\n\nThreatLocker flips the typical patching script by assuming that every change — even a vendor patch — must be treated as untrusted until verified.\n\nHere’s how it strengthens the process:\n\nBefore patches are made publicly available to organizations, it goes through an internal round of review and testing. ThreatLocker Application Engineers are the ones that make this possible. The team leverages the use of built-in applications, which are a repository of over 8000 applications that are commonly used. This gives security teams the foundation needed for a modern patch management solution. Here’s their approach:\n\nWhen CVE-2023-23397 — a zero-click vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook — was disclosed, it sent security teams scrambling. \nAttackers could trigger authentication leaks simply by sending a specially crafted email — no user interaction needed.\n\nOrganizations relying on traditional patch management workflows ran into immediate problems:\n\nThreatLocker users, however, were positioned to respond faster:\n\nInstead of days of scrambling, ThreatLocker customers were able to mitigate the risk window within hours — maintaining both system uptime and security integrity.\n\nThreatLocker Patch Management isn’t just about automating updates — it’s about giving security teams the tools they need to:\n\nIn an era where adversaries move faster than ever — leveraging automation, AI, and zero-day brokers — organizations can't afford manual, ad hoc patching practices.\n\nPrecision patch management is no longer a \"nice to have\" — it’s a core part of a modern cyber defense strategy.\n\nPatching is often called \"basic cyber hygiene,\" but in practice, doing it right is anything but simple. ThreatLocker Patch Management brings clarity, control, and speed to a process that has historically been riddled with risk and uncertainty.\n\nFor organizations serious about security, patch management must move beyond compliance checkboxes — it must become a strategic, security-first process.\n\nThreatLocker helps make that possible.\n\nLearn more about ThreatLocker Patch Management.\n\nSponsored and written by ThreatLocker.",

However, the crypto exchange said it would not pay the ransom but would establish a $20 million reward fund for tips that could help find the attackers who coordinated this attack and bring them to justice.\n\nWhile Coinbase is still assessing the breach's financial impact and the number of customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers in follow-up social engineering attacks is still unknown, the company said the resulting expenses will likely be \"within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million\" for remediation and customer refunds.\n\n\"Coinbase will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who mistakenly sent funds to the scammer as a direct result of this incident prior to the date of this post, following a review to confirm the facts,\" the company said.\n\nCoinbase advises customers to be cautious of scammers impersonating their employees, who may try to obtain funds or sensitive information like passwords or 2FA codes. If approached, hang up, as Coinbase will never ask for account details over the phone.

Microsoft has simply given us no other option.\"\n\nSignal's screen security might cause issues with screen readers, so those who want to turn it off can do so from Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.\n\nSignal will also show an alert before turning off screen security, warning that Windows can take screenshots of their Signal chats once the feature is disabled.\n\n\"Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing 'DRM' that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had,\" Lund added.\n\n​\"We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement 'one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn't be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.\"\n\nHowever, as Lund added, enabling Signal's screen security on your device will not protect against screenshots or recordings by others using screen readers on macOS or Linux devices.\n\nIn April, almost one year after its introduction, Microsoft started rolling out Windows Recall to all customers who installed the Windows 11 KB5055627 update on Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOne month later, the company made it generally available to everyone who installed the May 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nWindows 11's Recall AI is now rolling out on Copilot+ PCs\n\nWindows 11 and Red Hat Linux hacked on first day of Pwn2Own\n\nWindows 11 upgrade block lifted after Safe Exam Browser fix\n\nMicrosoft: Windows 11 24H2 now ready to rollout to everyone\n\nMicrosoft Teams will soon block screen capture during meetings",

The FTC found that GoDaddy was unaware of vulnerabilities in its hosting environment due to a lack of standard security measures.\n\nThe FTC's order prohibits the company from misleading customers about its security protections and mandates GoDaddy to establish a robust information security program, secure APIs using HTTPS or other secure transfer protocols, and set up a software and firmware update management program.\n\nThe order also requires GoDaddy to hire an independent third-party assessor to conduct biennial reviews of its information security program and report any incident where customer data was exposed, accessed, or stolen within 10 days.\n\nAmong other requirements, the hosting company has to add at least one mandatory MFA for all customers, employees, and contractors' staff \"to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database\" and \"at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security key.\"\n\nAccording to the FTC's complaint, GoDaddy had inadequate security practices, lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA), proper software update management, and logging of security events. It also failed to monitor for threats, segment its network, use file integrity monitoring, keep track of and manage its assets, assess risks to its hosting services, or secure service connections to consumer data.\n\nThe FTC says these security failures led to several major security breaches between 2019 and 2022, resulting in attackers gaining access to customers' data and websites. For instance, in February 2023, GoDaddy revealed that unknown threat actors installed malware on compromised servers and stole source code after breaching its cPanel shared hosting environment in a multi-year breach.\n\nThe company discovered the incident in early December 2022, only after receiving customer complaints that their websites were being abused to redirect to unknown domains. GoDaddy also disclosed at the time that breaches disclosed in March 2020 and November 2021 were linked to the same campaign.\n\nIn the November 2021 breach, attackers hacked into GoDaddy's hosting environment using a compromised password and stole email addresses, WordPress Admin passwords, sFTP and database credentials, and SSL private keys of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers. Following the March 2020 breach, GoDaddy notified 28,000 customers that an attacker used their web hosting credentials to connect via SSH in October 2019.\n\n\"We are constantly improving our security capabilities and have already implemented a number of the requirements in the settlement agreement with the FTC. Notably, the resolution of this matter includes no admission of fault and no monetary penalties,\" GoDaddy told BleepingComputer in January when the FTC issued a proposed settlement order.\n\n\"We expect minimal financial impact associated with complying with the terms of the agreement with the FTC.

He commented on the hackers’ deep knowledge about Ivanti systems saying that they know which files hold the information required for the next step of the attack, such as cleartext MySQL credentials, and targeting those specifically.\n\nThe entities targeted in the latest UNC5221 exploitation campaign are:\n\nThese were confirmed breaches, as evidenced by reverse shells, data exfiltration/database exports, persistent malware injections, and abuse of internal Office 365 tokens and LDAP configurations.\n\nBüyükkaya told BleepingComputer that based on the observed post-compromise activity, the threat actor was most likely engaged in espionage, monitoring high-value targets related to strategic interests.\n\nThe threat actor performed host reconnaissance by running system commands to gather details about the device, users, network, and configuration files, before dropping the KrystyLoader payload from a compromised AWS S3 bucket.\n\nThe output of those commands was temporarily saved as disguised .JPG files in a web-accessible directory, then immediately deleted to evade detection.\n\nThis indicates real-time data exfiltration, likely via HTTP GET requests, followed by artifact cleanup.\n\nThe EclecticIQ report also notes that the latest attacks conducted by UNC5221 feature links to the Linux backdoor ‘Auto-Color’ first reported by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 in February but without clear attribution at the time.\n\nThe latest attacks indicate that Chinese espionage groups continue to target network perimeter devices for initial access into target organizations.\n\nThe exploitation that EclecticIQ observed started two days after the public disclosure, highlighting the criticality of applying security updates as soon as possible.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nIvanti patches Connect Secure zero-day exploited since mid-March\n\nNewest Ivanti SSRF zero-day now under mass exploitation\n\nIvanti zero-day attacks infected devices with custom malware\n\nIvanti Connect Secure zero-days exploited to deploy custom malware\n\nIvanti fixes EPMM zero-days chained in code execution attacks",

The FTC found that GoDaddy was unaware of vulnerabilities in its hosting environment due to a lack of standard security measures.\n\nThe FTC's order prohibits the company from misleading customers about its security protections and mandates GoDaddy to establish a robust information security program, secure APIs using HTTPS or other secure transfer protocols, and set up a software and firmware update management program.\n\nThe order also requires GoDaddy to hire an independent third-party assessor to conduct biennial reviews of its information security program and report any incident where customer data was exposed, accessed, or stolen within 10 days.\n\nAmong other requirements, the hosting company has to add at least one mandatory MFA for all customers, employees, and contractors' staff \"to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database\" and \"at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security key.\"\n\nAccording to the FTC's complaint, GoDaddy had inadequate security practices, lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA), proper software update management, and logging of security events. It also failed to monitor for threats, segment its network, use file integrity monitoring, keep track of and manage its assets, assess risks to its hosting services, or secure service connections to consumer data.\n\nThe FTC says these security failures led to several major security breaches between 2019 and 2022, resulting in attackers gaining access to customers' data and websites. For instance, in February 2023, GoDaddy revealed that unknown threat actors installed malware on compromised servers and stole source code after breaching its cPanel shared hosting environment in a multi-year breach.\n\nThe company discovered the incident in early December 2022, only after receiving customer complaints that their websites were being abused to redirect to unknown domains. GoDaddy also disclosed at the time that breaches disclosed in March 2020 and November 2021 were linked to the same campaign.\n\nIn the November 2021 breach, attackers hacked into GoDaddy's hosting environment using a compromised password and stole email addresses, WordPress Admin passwords, sFTP and database credentials, and SSL private keys of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers. Following the March 2020 breach, GoDaddy notified 28,000 customers that an attacker used their web hosting credentials to connect via SSH in October 2019.\n\n\"We are constantly improving our security capabilities and have already implemented a number of the requirements in the settlement agreement with the FTC. Notably, the resolution of this matter includes no admission of fault and no monetary penalties,\" GoDaddy told BleepingComputer in January when the FTC issued a proposed settlement order.\n\n\"We expect minimal financial impact associated with complying with the terms of the agreement with the FTC. We plan to continue to invest in our defenses to address evolving threats and help keep our customers, their websites and their data safe.\"\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.",

Microsoft has simply given us no other option.\"\n\nSignal's screen security might cause issues with screen readers, so those who want to turn it off can do so from Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.\n\nSignal will also show an alert before turning off screen security, warning that Windows can take screenshots of their Signal chats once the feature is disabled.\n\n\"Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing 'DRM' that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had,\" Lund added.\n\n​\"We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement 'one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn't be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.\"\n\nHowever, as Lund added, enabling Signal's screen security on your device will not protect against screenshots or recordings by others using screen readers on macOS or Linux devices.\n\nIn April, almost one year after its introduction, Microsoft started rolling out Windows Recall to all customers who installed the Windows 11 KB5055627 update on Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOne month later, the company made it generally available to everyone who installed the May 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nWindows 11's Recall AI is now rolling out on Copilot+ PCs\n\nWindows 11 and Red Hat Linux hacked on first day of Pwn2Own\n\nWindows 11 upgrade block lifted after Safe Exam Browser fix\n\nMicrosoft: Windows 11 24H2 now ready to rollout to everyone\n\nMicrosoft Teams will soon block screen capture during meetings",

The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.\n\nThe carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).\n\nIn April, SK Telecom reported that threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.\n\nThe telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.\n\nSK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts. The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.\n\nSK Telecom revealed that the security breach began in 2022, exposing USIM data of 27 million users. To counter SIM-swapping risks, it is replacing all SIM cards and enhancing security to block unauthorized number porting.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the Personal Information Protection Committee found that malware compromised 25 types of data in the SK Telecom breach. SKT was instructed to notify all 25.64 million users, including budget phone users, by May 9. Leaked data includes phone numbers, IMSIs, SIM keys, and HSS-stored info.\n\n“The personal information that has been confirmed to have been leaked so far is a total of 25 types, including users’ mobile phone numbers, IMSI (subscriber identification number), SIM authentication keys, and other SIM-related information that were stored in HSS*.” states the Personal Information Protection Committee. “This measure was taken based on the committee’s judgment that the leaked information is important personal information that is used as a key means of identifying and connecting individuals in the mobile era, and therefore requires special attention.”\n\nSK Telecom announced it will notify 26.95 million users affected by a malware breach that exposed sensitive data. The firm found 25 malware types across 23 servers, revealing a far more extensive attack than expected.\n\n“We have isolated 25 types of malware discovered and 23 infected servers, and there has been no confirmation of leakage of 290,000 IMEIs, terminal cloning is virtually impossible, and the network is also blocked through FDS.” reads an update published by the company.\n\nA joint probe found the initial infection occurred on June 15, 2022, staying undetected for nearly three years.\n\n“The second investigation results additionally revealed that SKT did not notice that it had been infected with malicious code for nearly 3 years. The investigation team announced that after inspecting all 30,000 of SKT’s Linux servers four times, a total of 23 servers were infected with malicious code.” reported the website KBS. “The first malware infiltration occurred on June 15, 2022, and was confirmed to be a ‘web shell’ series code that took over the server. The investigation team said that the web shell code subsequently played a role in calling in difficult-to-detect backdoor (BPF door) series malware, and a total of 25 types of malware were found in SKT’s internal system.”\n\nSK Telecom ensures illegal USIM and device changes are fully blocked and pledges full responsibility if any damage still occurs.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSK Telecom",

It allows developers to integrate secure end-to-end encryption features directly into web applications, browser extensions, or server-side tools using JavaScript.\n\nA critical flaw in OpenPGP.js versions 5.0.1 to 5.11.2 and 6.0.0 to 6.1.0 allows spoofing of inline-signed or signed+encrypted messages. Attackers can craft messages that return valid signature checks on data not actually signed, misleading recipients. Detached signatures are unaffected.\n\n“This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using openpgp.verify) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using openpgp.decrypt with verificationKeys) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case.” reads the advisory. “In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker’s choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js.”\n\nThe vulnerability allows attackers to alter inline-signed or signed+encrypted messages to contain any content, while still appearing to have a valid signature.\n\nResearchers Edoardo Geraci and Thomas Rinsma of Codean Labs discovered the vulnerability.\n\nThe issue is patched in 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, with workarounds available via manual signature checks.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, CVE-2025-47934)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER",

        "content": "SK TELECOM REVEALED THAT MALWARE BREACH BEGAN IN 2022\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 21, 2025\nSouth Korean mobile network operator SK Telecom revealed that the security breach disclosed in April began in 2022.\n\nSK Telecom is South Korea’s largest wireless telecom company, a major player in the country’s mobile and tech landscape.\n\nIt holds about 48% of the market share for mobile services, meaning around 34 million subscribers use its network. The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.\n\nThe carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).\n\nIn April, SK Telecom reported that threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.\n\nThe telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.\n\nSK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts. The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.\n\nSK Telecom revealed that the security breach began in 2022, exposing USIM data of 27 million users. To counter SIM-swapping risks, it is replacing all SIM cards and enhancing security to block unauthorized number porting.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the Personal Information Protection Committee found that malware compromised 25 types of data in the SK Telecom breach. SKT was instructed to notify all 25.64 million users, including budget phone users, by May 9. Leaked data includes phone numbers, IMSIs, SIM keys, and HSS-stored info.\n\n“The personal information that has been confirmed to have been leaked so far is a total of 25 types, including users’ mobile phone numbers, IMSI (subscriber identification number), SIM authentication keys, and other SIM-related information that were stored in HSS*.” states the Personal Information Protection Committee. “This measure was taken based on the committee’s judgment that the leaked information is important personal information that is used as a key means of identifying and connecting individuals in the mobile era, and therefore requires special attention.”\n\nSK Telecom announced it will notify 26.95 million users affected by a malware breach that exposed sensitive data. The firm found 25 malware types across 23 servers, revealing a far more extensive attack than expected.\n\n“We have isolated 25 types of malware discovered and 23 infected servers, and there has been no confirmation of leakage of 290,000 IMEIs, terminal cloning is virtually impossible, and the network is also blocked through FDS.” reads an update published by the company.\n\nA joint probe found the initial infection occurred on June 15, 2022, staying undetected for nearly three years.\n\n“The second investigation results additionally revealed that SKT did not notice that it had been infected with malicious code for nearly 3 years. The investigation team announced that after inspecting all 30,000 of SKT’s Linux servers four times, a total of 23 servers were infected with malicious code.” reported the website KBS. “The first malware infiltration occurred on June 15, 2022, and was confirmed to be a ‘web shell’ series code that took over the server. The investigation team said that the web shell code subsequently played a role in calling in difficult-to-detect backdoor (BPF door) series malware, and a total of 25 types of malware were found in SKT’s internal system.”\n\nSK Telecom ensures illegal USIM and device changes are fully blocked and pledges full responsibility if any damage still occurs.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSK Telecom",

The experts uncovered the attacks in March 2023 and again in 2024, noting that the group used spear-phishing emails with fake flight ticket lures to breach systems.\n\nUnsolicitedBooker has repeatedly targeted government organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, using spear-phishing emails to deliver malware. Their toolkit includes backdoors such as Chinoxy, DeedRAT, Poison Ivy, and BeRAT, commonly associated with Chinese APT groups.\n\nThe above backdoors are shared among multiple China-linked APT groups.\n\n“The group also deployed custom file stealers; therefore, we believe that the motivation of this threat actor is espionage and data theft. UnsolicitedBooker sends spearphishing emails, generally with a flight ticket as the decoy, and its targets include governmental organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” reads the report published by ESET. “According to our investigation, UnsolicitedBooker overlaps with both Space Pirates and an unnamed threat actor that uses the Zardoor backdoor.”\n\nIn January 2025, UnsolicitedBooker launched another spearphishing attack against the same Saudi organization previously targeted. The phishing email, impersonating Saudia airline, came from saudia.etickets@outlook[.]com and included a fake flight ticket in a Word document, based on a PDF from Academia.edu.\n\nThe researchers observed that in 2024, UnsolicitedBooker reused the same ticket decoy from earlier attacks, embedding a VBA macro that drops a MarsSnake backdoor loader. The payload is saved as smssdrvhost.exe, and PDB paths confirm the MarsSnake name. The threat actors used the C&C server contact.decenttoy[.]top. Two more phishing attempts were also detected at the same target.\n\n“The multiple attempts at compromising this organization in 2023, 2024, and 2025 indicate a strong interest by UnsolicitedBooker in this specific target.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nbackdoor\nChina\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nMarsSnake\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nUnsolicitedBooker",

It manages payments to legal professionals and supports vulnerable individuals, including asylum seekers and people in family or criminal cases.\n\nFollowing the cyberattack, the UK Legal Aid Agency acted swiftly to enhance system security and notified legal aid providers of a possible data breach. The Agency investigated the security breach with the help of the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre. On May 16, it was revealed that the breach was more extensive than initially believed, with hackers accessing and downloading sensitive personal data of legal aid applicants dating back to 2010. The agencies notified the authorities.\n\n“On Friday 16 May we discovered the attack was more extensive than originally understood and that the group behind it had accessed a large amount of information relating to legal aid applicants.” reads the update published by the agency. “We believe the group has accessed and downloaded a significant amount of personal data from those who applied for legal aid through our digital service since 2010.”\n\nDownloaded data may have included contact details and addresses of applicants, their dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment status and financial data such as contribution amounts, debts and payments.\n\n“I understand this news will be shocking and upsetting for people and I am extremely sorry this has happened.\n\nSince the discovery of the attack, my team has been working around the clock with the National Cyber Security Centre to bolster the security of our systems so we can safely continue the vital work of the agency.” Jane Harbottle, Chief Executive Officer of the Legal Aid Agency, said. “However, it has become clear that to safeguard the service and its users, we needed to take radical action. That is why we’ve taken the decision to take the online service down.\n\nWe have put in place the necessary contingency plans to ensure those most in need of legal support and advice can continue to access the help they need during this time.”\n\nThe UK Legal Aid Agency has joined a growing list of high-profile victims in a recent surge of cyberattacks. Harrods, Marks & Spencer, and the Co-op were also targeted, facing system disruptions, financial losses, and operational setbacks.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLegal Aid Agency\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

It manages payments to legal professionals and supports vulnerable individuals, including asylum seekers and people in family or criminal cases.\n\nFollowing the cyberattack, the UK Legal Aid Agency acted swiftly to enhance system security and notified legal aid providers of a possible data breach. The Agency investigated the security breach with the help of the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre.

The experts uncovered the attacks in March 2023 and again in 2024, noting that the group used spear-phishing emails with fake flight ticket lures to breach systems.\n\nUnsolicitedBooker has repeatedly targeted government organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, using spear-phishing emails to deliver malware. Their toolkit includes backdoors such as Chinoxy, DeedRAT, Poison Ivy, and BeRAT, commonly associated with Chinese APT groups.\n\nThe above backdoors are shared among multiple China-linked APT groups.\n\n“The group also deployed custom file stealers; therefore, we believe that the motivation of this threat actor is espionage and data theft. UnsolicitedBooker sends spearphishing emails, generally with a flight ticket as the decoy, and its targets include governmental organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” reads the report published by ESET. “According to our investigation, UnsolicitedBooker overlaps with both Space Pirates and an unnamed threat actor that uses the Zardoor backdoor.”\n\nIn January 2025, UnsolicitedBooker launched another spearphishing attack against the same Saudi organization previously targeted. The phishing email, impersonating Saudia airline, came from saudia.etickets@outlook[.]com and included a fake flight ticket in a Word document, based on a PDF from Academia.edu.\n\nThe researchers observed that in 2024, UnsolicitedBooker reused the same ticket decoy from earlier attacks, embedding a VBA macro that drops a MarsSnake backdoor loader. The payload is saved as smssdrvhost.exe, and PDB paths confirm the MarsSnake name. The threat actors used the C&C server contact.decenttoy[.]top. Two more phishing attempts were also detected at the same target.\n\n“The multiple attempts at compromising this organization in 2023, 2024, and 2025 indicate a strong interest by UnsolicitedBooker in this specific target.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nbackdoor\nChina\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nMarsSnake\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nUnsolicitedBooker",

        "content": "LAW ENFORCEMENT DISMANTLED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND LUMMA STEALER MAAS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nMicrosoft found 394,000 Windows systems talking to Lumma stealer controllers, a victim pool that included global manufacturers.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.\n\n“The Justice Department announced today the unsealing of two warrants authorizing the seizure of five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 information-stealing malware service.” reads the press release published by DoJ.\n\nLumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.\n\nThe malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.\n\nMicrosoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.\n\nMicrosoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.\n\nLumma Stealer uses a layered C2 infrastructure with hardcoded tier 1 servers and fallback C2s via Telegram and Steam, all hidden behind Cloudflare. Telegram is prioritized, and Steam is used if others fail. Affiliates can pay for personal C2s. All communication is encrypted via HTTPS.\n\n“Different types of obfuscation are applied to each set of C2 servers. For example, the hardcoded list of C2s, and including the Telegram fallback C2 URL are protected with ChaCha20 crypto, while the Steam profile fallback C2 URL is encrypted using custom stack-based crypto algorithm that can change on each version of Lumma malware.” states Microsoft. “We have identified up to six versions of Lumma Stealer, and while each of these versions focuses on improving techniques to evade antivirus detections, there are also several changes in the C2 communication protocol and formats such as the C2 domains, URI path, POST data, and others. The core Lumma malware stores the build date as part of the embedded configuration to keep track of improvements, but in our investigation, we tracked major changes using the labels “version 1” through “version 6”.”\n\nThe FBI and US CISA also released a joint advisory that includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Lumma Stealer along with indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n“Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLumma Stealer\nMaaS\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

        "content": "LAW ENFORCEMENT DISMANTLED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND LUMMA STEALER MAAS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nMicrosoft found 394,000 Windows systems talking to Lumma stealer controllers, a victim pool that included global manufacturers.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.\n\n“The Justice Department announced today the unsealing of two warrants authorizing the seizure of five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 information-stealing malware service.” reads the press release published by DoJ.\n\nLumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.\n\nThe malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.\n\nMicrosoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.\n\nMicrosoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.\n\nLumma Stealer uses a layered C2 infrastructure with hardcoded tier 1 servers and fallback C2s via Telegram and Steam, all hidden behind Cloudflare. Telegram is prioritized, and Steam is used if others fail. Affiliates can pay for personal C2s. All communication is encrypted via HTTPS.\n\n“Different types of obfuscation are applied to each set of C2 servers. For example, the hardcoded list of C2s, and including the Telegram fallback C2 URL are protected with ChaCha20 crypto, while the Steam profile fallback C2 URL is encrypted using custom stack-based crypto algorithm that can change on each version of Lumma malware.” states Microsoft. “We have identified up to six versions of Lumma Stealer, and while each of these versions focuses on improving techniques to evade antivirus detections, there are also several changes in the C2 communication protocol and formats such as the C2 domains, URI path, POST data, and others. The core Lumma malware stores the build date as part of the embedded configuration to keep track of improvements, but in our investigation, we tracked major changes using the labels “version 1” through “version 6”.”\n\nThe FBI and US CISA also released a joint advisory that includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Lumma Stealer along with indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n“Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLumma Stealer\nMaaS\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

        "content": "NEW SIGNAL UPDATE STOPS WINDOWS FROM CAPTURING USER CHATS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nSignal implements new screen security on Windows 11, blocking screenshots by default to protect user privacy from Microsoft’s Recall feature.\n\nA Signal update for the Windows app prevents the system from capturing screenshots by default. The feature protects users’ privacy from Microsoft’s Recall feature.\n\n“Signal Desktop now includes support for a new “Screen security” setting that is designed to help prevent your own computer from capturing screenshots of your Signal chats on Windows. This setting is automatically enabled by default in Signal Desktop on Windows 11.” reads the announcement published by Signal. “If you’re wondering why we’re only implementing this on Windows right now, it’s because the purpose of this setting is to protect your Signal messages from Microsoft Recall.”\n\nThe feature announced by Microsoft” Copilot+ PCs in 2024 captures screenshots of the user’s laptop every few seconds.\n\n“You can use Recall on Copilot+ PCs to find the content you have viewed on your device. Recall is currently in preview status; during this phase, we will collect customer feedback, develop more controls for enterprise customers to manage and govern Recall data, and improve the overall experience for users.” reads the announcement.\n\nMicrosoft explained that the Recall feature will store encrypted snapshots locally on the user’s computer, the feature will be only implemented in forthcoming Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft doesn’t have access to the snapshot.\n\nPrivacy advocates expressed their concerns about the potential abuses of the feature.\n\nThe IT giant attempted to downplay the risks for the users, it pointed out that the feature was developed with privacy and security by design and it is an “optional experience.”\n\nMicrosoft added that Recall does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, such as InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge.\n\nUsers can manage which snapshots Recall collects, excluding specific apps or websites. They can also pause snapshot collection, clear some or all stored snapshots, or delete all snapshots from their device.\n\nThe company suspended the rollout of the features following the public concerns, but recently started testing it again.\n\n“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk.” continues Signal. “As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.”\n\nSignal’s new screen security blocks screenshots, showing only a blank screen. Unfortunately, it may affect some accessibility software, including screen readers or magnification tools for people who are visually impaired. Users can disable it via settings, with a warning and confirmation to avoid accidental deactivation.\n\nSignal said that when you are trying to take a screenshot with the new screen security setting enabled, you will just get a blank screen.\n\nSignal’s screen security on Windows 11 is easy to disable, but the developers say it is hard to turn off accidentally, requiring a warning and confirmation. The setting only applies locally and doesn’t affect screenshots or accessibility tools on other devices like macOS or Linux.\n\n“We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn’t have to implement “one weird trick” in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.” concludes the announcement.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, privacy)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nPierluigi Paganini\nprivacy\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSignal",

When chained together, successful exploitation could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution.” reads the advisory. “We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.”\n\nEclecticIQ observed active exploitation of Ivanti EPMM flaws starting May 15, 2025 (the same day Ivanti disclosed two critical vulnerabilities) targeting internet-exposed systems.\n\n“EclecticIQ analysts observed active exploitation of this vulnerability chain in the wild, targeting internet-facing Ivanti EPMM deployments.” reads the post published by EclecticIQ. “The earliest observed exploitation activity dates back to May 15, 2025. Targeted organizations span critical sectors including healthcare, telecommunications, aviation, municipal government, finance, and defense across Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.”\n\nThe researchers linked the attacks to China-linked group UNC5221 that exploited Ivanti EPMM flaws to steal PII and credentials, enabling lateral movement. The group repurposed system tools and targeted mobile device management. Ivanti has released patches; users are urged to update immediately.\n\nThreat actors exploited an unauthenticated RCE flaw in Ivanti EPMM via the /mifs/rs/api/v2/?format= endpoint, using Java Reflection to run remote commands. Then attackers gained reverse shells and read output using crafted HTTP GET requests, forming a C2 channel. These techniques enabled full remote control over targeted systems through server-side Java injection.\n\nChinese cyber spies deployed the KrustyLoader malware on Ivanti EPMM systems, using Amazon S3 buckets to deliver their malicious files. Researchers observed that the attackers relied on standard Linux tools like wget and curl to download an encrypted version of the Sliver backdoor. KrustyLoader then decrypted the payload using built-in AES keys and loaded it directly into memory, giving the attackers stealthy, long-term access—even after the system was patched.\n\nEclecticIQ analysts found that Chinese-linked hackers targeted the mifs database in Ivanti EPMM systems as a key part of their espionage campaigns. After breaching the system, they used hardcoded MySQL credentials, stored insecurely in system files, to access the database, which contains sensitive information like mobile device data (IMEI, SIM, location), LDAP user details, and Office 365 tokens.\n\nUsing tools like mysqldump and Bash scripts downloaded from paste sites, the attackers extracted LDAP configs, Office 365 credentials, and metadata on managed devices. This information could allow unauthorized access to Microsoft cloud services like email and SharePoint.\n\nThe attackers also dumped memory from Java processes to search for more credentials, saving the data in temporary directories for later exfiltration. In short, they abused built-in Ivanti tools and weak credential storage to steal vast amounts of sensitive data—likely for espionage targeting key public and private sector individuals.\n\nChinese-linked hackers deployed FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) on compromised Ivanti EPMM systems to maintain stealthy access. Downloaded from an attacker-controlled IP, FRP allowed reverse SOCKS5 connections, enabling internal network scanning and lateral movement. Using tools like wget, they staged and launched KrustyLoader malware, hid reconnaissance output as fake JPG files, and exfiltrated data before deleting traces.\n\n“EclecticIQ assesses with high confidence that the observed Ivanti EPMM exploitation activity is very likely linked to UNC5221, a China-nexus cyber-espionage group.

These videos trick users into running PowerShell commands disguised as software activation steps for tools like Windows, Office, CapCut, or Spotify. The researchers pointed out that come videos have reached over 500,000 views, increasing the threat’s reach via TikTok’s algorithm.\n\n“Threat actors are now using TikTok videos that are potentially generated using AI-powered tools to socially engineer users into executing PowerShell commands under the guise of guiding them to activate legitimate software or unlock premium features.” reads the report published by Trend Micro. “This campaign highlights how attackers are ready to weaponize whichever social media platforms are currently popular to distribute malware.”\n\nResearchers discovered several TikTok accounts, now deactivated, posting the likely AI-generated videos. The videos are nearly identical, suggesting automated creation using AI for both visuals and voice, and were used to distribute malware payloads.\n\nA TikTok video urging users to run a PowerShell command gained nearly 500,000 views, 20,000+ likes, and 100+ comments, showing high engagement and trust.\n\nThe video provides step-by-step instructions to run a PowerShell command that downloads malware.

        "content": "CHINA-LINKED APT UNC5221 STARTED EXPLOITING IVANTI EPMM FLAWS SHORTLY AFTER THEIR DISCLOSURE\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 26, 2025\nChina-linked APT exploit Ivanti EPMM flaws to target critical sectors across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, according to EclecticIQ.\n\nResearchers from EclecticIQ observed a China-linked APT group that chained two Ivanti EPMM flaws, tracked as CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428, in attacks against organizations in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.\n\nBelow is the description of the flaws:\n\nCVE-2025-4427 (CVSS score: 5.3) – An authentication bypass in Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to access protected resources without proper credentials. \nCVE-2025-4428 (CVSS score: 7.2) – A remote code execution vulnerability in Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system. \n\nCERT-EU reported both vulnerabilities to the software firm.\n\nIvanti confirmed that threat actors could chain the two vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution without authentication.\n\n“Ivantii has released updates for Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) which addresses one medium and one high severity vulnerability. When chained together, successful exploitation could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution.” reads the advisory. “We are aware of a very limited number of customers whose solution has been exploited at the time of disclosure.”\n\nEclecticIQ observed active exploitation of Ivanti EPMM flaws starting May 15, 2025 (the same day Ivanti disclosed two critical vulnerabilities) targeting internet-exposed systems.\n\n“EclecticIQ analysts observed active exploitation of this vulnerability chain in the wild, targeting internet-facing Ivanti EPMM deployments.” reads the post published by EclecticIQ. “The earliest observed exploitation activity dates back to May 15, 2025. Targeted organizations span critical sectors including healthcare, telecommunications, aviation, municipal government, finance, and defense across Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.”\n\nThe researchers linked the attacks to China-linked group UNC5221 that exploited Ivanti EPMM flaws to steal PII and credentials, enabling lateral movement. The group repurposed system tools and targeted mobile device management. Ivanti has released patches; users are urged to update immediately.\n\nThreat actors exploited an unauthenticated RCE flaw in Ivanti EPMM via the /mifs/rs/api/v2/?format= endpoint, using Java Reflection to run remote commands. Then attackers gained reverse shells and read output using crafted HTTP GET requests, forming a C2 channel. These techniques enabled full remote control over targeted systems through server-side Java injection.\n\nChinese cyber spies deployed the KrustyLoader malware on Ivanti EPMM systems, using Amazon S3 buckets to deliver their malicious files. Researchers observed that the attackers relied on standard Linux tools like wget and curl to download an encrypted version of the Sliver backdoor. KrustyLoader then decrypted the payload using built-in AES keys and loaded it directly into memory, giving the attackers stealthy, long-term access—even after the system was patched.\n\nEclecticIQ analysts found that Chinese-linked hackers targeted the mifs database in Ivanti EPMM systems as a key part of their espionage campaigns. After breaching the system, they used hardcoded MySQL credentials, stored insecurely in system files, to access the database, which contains sensitive information like mobile device data (IMEI, SIM, location), LDAP user details, and Office 365 tokens.\n\nUsing tools like mysqldump and Bash scripts downloaded from paste sites, the attackers extracted LDAP configs, Office 365 credentials, and metadata on managed devices. This information could allow unauthorized access to Microsoft cloud services like email and SharePoint.\n\nThe attackers also dumped memory from Java processes to search for more credentials, saving the data in temporary directories for later exfiltration. In short, they abused built-in Ivanti tools and weak credential storage to steal vast amounts of sensitive data—likely for espionage targeting key public and private sector individuals.\n\nChinese-linked hackers deployed FRP (Fast Reverse Proxy) on compromised Ivanti EPMM systems to maintain stealthy access. Downloaded from an attacker-controlled IP, FRP allowed reverse SOCKS5 connections, enabling internal network scanning and lateral movement. Using tools like wget, they staged and launched KrustyLoader malware, hid reconnaissance output as fake JPG files, and exfiltrated data before deleting traces.\n\n“EclecticIQ assesses with high confidence that the observed Ivanti EPMM exploitation activity is very likely linked to UNC5221, a China-nexus cyber-espionage group. Infrastructure reuse and observed tradecraft closely align with previous campaigns attributed to this actor.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, China)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nIvanti EPMM\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nUNC5221",

The malware spreads via malspam campaigns, it inserts replies in active email threads.\n\nGallyamov began developing Qakbot in 2008, building a team that expanded its capabilities over the time. Used for over a decade, it served as a trojan, dropper, and backdoor.\n\nSince 2019, Qakbot has served as an attack vector in ransomware operations by major gangs like Conti, REvil, Black Basta, Egregor, and others.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize over $24M in crypto from Gallyamov, part of a multinational cybercrime crackdown.\n\n“A federal indictment unsealed today charges Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, 48, of Moscow, Russia, with leading a group of cyber criminals who developed and deployed the Qakbot malware. In connection with the charges, the Justice Department filed today a civil forfeiture complaint against over $24 million in cryptocurrency seized from Gallyamov over the course of the investigation.” reads the press release published by DoJ. “These actions are the latest step in an ongoing multinational effort by the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Canada to combat cybercrime.”\n\nThe DOJ’s latest charges build on the 2023 Operation ‘Duck Hunt’ that dismantled the Qakbot botnet, revealing Gallyamov and his team continued attacks using “spam bombs” and ransomware like Black Basta and Cactus into 2025. Over 170 BTC and millions in crypto were previously seized.\n\nIn November 2022, experts at the Cybereason Global SOC (GSOC) team observed a surge in Qakbot infections as part of an ongoing aggressive Qakbot malware campaign that led to Black Basta ransomware infections in the US.\n\nAccording to the FBI’s 2023 announcement, crimes associated with Qakbot attacks caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to individuals and businesses in the U.S. and abroad. \n\nThe FBI explained that as part of the operation has gained lawful access to Qakbot’s C2 infrastructure and identified over 700,000 infected computers worldwide. More than 200,000 infected computers were in the U.S.\n\n“Investigators have found evidence that, between October 2021 and April 2023, Qakbot administrators received fees corresponding to approximately $58 million in ransoms paid by victims,” states the Justice Department.\n\nThe FBI performed a sinkholing of the botnet and once replaced the C2 infrastructure instructed the bot to download an uninstaller file and execute it to remove the Qakbot malware.\n\nDespite the Qakbot takedown, Gallyamov continued attacks through January 2025. The DOJ has now filed to forfeit over $24 million in seized cryptocurrency.\n\n“On April 25, 2025, pursuant to a seizure warrant, the FBI seized additional illicit proceeds from Gallyamov, including over 30 bitcoin and over $700,000 of USDT tokens. Today, the Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the Central District of California against all of the illicit proceeds seized from Gallyamov — worth over $24 million as of today — in order to forfeit and ultimately return those funds to victims.” continues DoJ.\n\nThe actions are part of Operation Endgame, a global law enforcement effort targeting cybercriminal groups.

        "content": "JAPAN PASSED A LAW ALLOWING PREEMPTIVE OFFENSIVE CYBER ACTIONS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 19, 2025\nJapan passed a law allowing preemptive offensive cyber actions, shifting from its pacifist stance to bolster defenses like major Western powers.\n\nJapan has enacted the Active Cyberdefense Law, allowing preemptive offensive cyber operations to counter threats before damage occurs. This marks a shift from Japan’s pacifist stance under Article 9, aiming to elevate its cyber defense to match major Western powers and enable broader military support to allies.\n\nThe law allows government agencies to carry out hacking back operations, infiltrating and neutralizing infrastructure employed by threat actors to target the country and its organizations.\n\nJapan’s new Active Cyberdefense Law also lets authorities preemptively target hostile infrastructure, even before attacks occur. It also enables Self-Defence Forces to aid allies and handle advanced cyber threats, reflecting a shift in the interpretation of Article 9 for national and allied security.\n\nThe Japanese government aims to make the new legal framework fully operational by 2027.\n\n“The new law is intended to enable Japan to “identify and respond to cyber attacks more quickly and effectively” according to Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, who added on Friday that it would help Tokyo “equal or exceed” the cyber capabilities “of major European countries and the US.”” reported The Record Media.\n\nThe Japanese government will monitor and analyze IP addresses involved in international communications passing through or to/from Japan. Domestic communications and message content, such as email bodies, are excluded from surveillance.\n\n“A new independent panel will be set up to give prior approval for data acquisition and analysis, as well as for actions to neutralize hostile servers. It will also be tasked with ensuring that government surveillance is being properly conducted.” reported by Kyodo News. “In response to concerns from opposition parties over potential government overreach and violation of the constitutional right to secrecy of communications, the government revised legislation and stipulated specific provisions in the law to uphold personal rights.”\n\nJapan remains a target for both financially motivated threat actors and APT groups.\n\nIn April 2025, Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned of hundreds of millions in unauthorized trades linked to hacked brokerage accounts.\n\nIn March 2025, a data breach suffered by the Japanese telecom giant NTT exposed information of nearly 18,000 corporate customers.\n\nIn December, a cyberattack hit Japan Airlines (JAL), causing the suspension of ticket sales for flights departing on Thursday.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Japan)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nJapan\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

Now the former FBI chief faces MAGA backlash after his post.\n\nDHS Secretary Noem confirmed the Secret Service is investigating.\n\nWe vigorously investigate anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees.

And Trump is the 47th US president.\n\nComey insisted he did not know what the numbers meant, but Trump has disputed that.\n\nComey said he found the seashells already arranged as “8647” and assumed it was a political message. Critics, including Trump allies, claim it’s a coded threat, with “86” meaning “get rid of” and “47” referencing Trump as the 47th president. Merriam-Webster notes “86” can imply removal, and some modern uses suggest violence. Comey now faces a federal investigation, according to White House officials, as Republicans argue the photo signals a threat to Trump.\n\nComey later explained that he “assumed the seashells were a political message.”\n\n“I didn’t realise some folks associate those numbers with violence,” he added. “It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” he added.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, 8647)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\n8647\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nJames Comey\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

With over 813 million weekly visits, the App Store remains a secure and popular hub for apps worldwide.\n\nThe tech giant shared additional figures highlighting its extensive efforts to protect both users and the developer community.\n\nIn 2024, the company removed over 146,000 developer accounts and blocked 139,000 enrollments for fraudulent activities. It also rejected 711 million fake customer accounts and deactivated nearly 129 million customer accounts to stop spam, scams, and manipulation. Beyond the App Store, Apple blocked over 10,000 pirate apps and halted 4.6 million attempts to install unauthorized apps.\n\n“Before any app makes its way onto the App Store, it is vetted by a member of Apple’s App Review team, all of whom are deeply familiar with the App Review Guidelines, and focused on ensuring apps meet Apple’s standards for quality and safety. On average, this team reviews nearly 150,000 app submissions each week, helping bring new apps and updates to the App Store. Last year, App Review helped more than 220,000 developers publish their first app on the App Store.” reads the announcement published by the company. “App Review involves both human review and automated processes to detect and take action on apps that are suspected to be potentially harmful to users.”\n\nIn 2024, the company experts reviewed over 7.7 million App Store submissions and rejected more than 1.9 million for violating standards on security, privacy, and user experience. Its App Review team blocked over 37,000 apps tied to fraud and took down 43,000 with hidden or undocumented features. The IT giant also rejected over 320,000 scam or spam apps and removed 17,000 bait-and-switch apps. Privacy remained a top focus, with 400,000 apps rejected for violating user data policies.\n\nIn 2024, Apple cracked down on manipulation in the App Store by removing over 143 million fake ratings and reviews from the 1.2 billion it processed. It also took down 7,400 apps from charts and nearly 9,500 from search results for deceptive tactics like using bots or paid boosts. On the payments side, Apple blocked over $2 billion in fraud, banned 1.6 million accounts, and flagged 4.7 million stolen cards. Tools like Apple Pay and StoreKit kept 420,000+ apps and their users secure.\n\n“Apple will continue to build on its commitment to provide users with the safest and most secure experience on the App Store, which includes empowering them with resources to get help and report suspected fraud.

The attacks caused major disruptions and over $19 million in damages to Baltimore alone, affecting key services like billing and citations. Gholinejad and his co-conspirators used these high-impact incidents to pressure future victims into paying ransoms.\n\nIn May 2019, for the second time in a year, the systems of the city of Baltimore were hit by a ransomware attack, forcing officials to shut down a majority of them.\n\nThe attack impacted multiple services, including online payment portals for water bills and and property taxes.\n\n“Gholinejad and his co-conspirators — all of whom were overseas — caused tens of millions of dollars in losses and disrupted essential public services by deploying the Robbinhood ransomware against U.

There will be no impunity for these destructive attacks.”\n\nStarting in 2019, Gholinejad and and his co-conspirators hacked into U.S. networks, stole data, and deployed Robbinhood ransomware to demand Bitcoin ransoms. They laundered payments using crypto mixers and chain-hopping, while masking their identities with VPNs and private servers.\n\nSina Gholinejad pleaded guilty to computer fraud and wire fraud conspiracy.

Detection efforts should prioritize monitoring remote access to DCOM objects, tracking modifications to key registry entries like RunAs and LmCompatibilityLevel, and scrutinizing unexpected activations of the WebClient service.\n\nAs the RemoteMonologue attack underscores, the decades-old COM technology remains a potent attack surface, urging organizations to revisit their security posture to counter these sophisticated, fileless threats before they escalate into full-scale breaches.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "title": "How 'Browser-in-the-Middle' Attacks Steal Sessions in Seconds",
        "content": "날짜: May 28, 2025\n\n본문:\nWould you expect an end user to log on to a cybercriminal's computer, open their browser, and type in their usernames and passwords? Hopefully not! But that's essentially what happens if they fall victim to a Browser-in-the-Middle (BitM) attack.\n\nLike Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, BiTM sees criminals look to control the data flow between the victim's computer and the target service, as University of Salento researchers Franco Tommasi, Christian Catalano, and Ivan Taurino have outlined in a paper for the International Journal of Information Security. However, there are several key differences.\n\nA MiTM attack utilizes a proxy server that places itself between the victim's browser and the legitimate target service at the application layer. It needs some kind of malware to be placed and run on the victim's computer.\n\nBut a BiTM attack is different. Instead, the victim thinks they're using their own browser – conducting their normal online banking, for instance – when instead they're actually running a transparent remote browser.\n\nAs the paper notes, it's as though the user were \"sitting in front of the attacker's computer, using the attacker's keyboard\", meaning the attacker can capture, record, and alter the data exchange between the victim and the service they're accessing.\n\nSo how does it work? A typical BitM attack occurs in three phases:\n\nThe attack works by targeting session tokens. This enables the attackers to subvert even multi-factor authentication (MFA); once the user has finished their MFA, a session token is usually stored in their browser. As researchers from Google subsidiary Mandiant have noted, if the token itself can be stolen, then MFA no longer matters:\n\n\"Stealing this session token is the equivalent of stealing the authenticated session, meaning an adversary would no longer need to perform the MFA challenge.\" This makes the tokens a useful target for both red team operators – who test a system's defenses – and more worryingly, genuine adversaries.\n\nBy employing a BitM framework in targeting authenticated session tokens, attackers enjoy the benefits of a rapid targeting capability, as they can reach any website in just seconds with little need for configuration, notes Mandiant. When an application is targeted, the legitimate site is served through the attacker-controlled browser, making it extremely difficult for the victim to tell the difference between a real site and its fake counterpart.\n\nCookies or OAuth tokens are snatched just before encryption, while rapid exfiltration means the stolen tokens can be relayed to attacker servers in seconds.\n\nThese sophisticated attacks can cause significant damage, but there are ways to avoid or mitigate the consequences. At the widest level, users must always take extreme care over the links they access, perhaps previewing the site before actually clicking on any links. Here are some other options:\n\nThe conclusion is depressingly clear: BiTM attacks can circumvent traditional security approaches, even enabling criminals to intercept usernames and passwords. So does this make passwords irrelevant?\n\nThe answer is a resounding 'no'. By instituting multi-factor authentication (MFA) – including robust passwords – you still make life harder for cybercriminals, particularly if they fail to capture the session token right away.\n\nEven as attackers become more sophisticated, you need to keep an eye on the basics. Passwords remain a vital component of MFA – in fact, for most organizations, they likely remain the first line of defense. Frustrate cybercriminals by protecting your passwords, no matter how they attack.\n\nSpecops Password Policy ensures your Active Directory passwords are up to scratch at all times. You can enforce stronger password policies while also continuously scanning your Active Directory for over 4 billion compromised passwords. Combined with effective MFA such as Specops Secure Access, you'll protect your end users at both the password and logon steps. Need assistance with MFA or password security? Reach out for a chat.",

The list of IP addresses to target is retrieved from an external server (\"ssh.ddos-cc[.]org\").\n\nAs part of its brute-force attempts, the malware also performs various checks to determine if the system is suitable and is not a honeypot. Furthermore, it checks the presence of the string \"Pumatronix,\" a manufacturer of surveillance and traffic camera systems, indicating either an attempt to specifically single them out or exclude them.\n\nThe malware then proceeds to collect and exfiltrate basic system information to the C2 server, after which it sets up persistence and executes commands received from the server.\n\n\"The malware writes itself to /lib/redis, attempting to disguise itself as a legitimate Redis system file,\" Darktrace said. \"It then creates a persistent systemd service in /etc/systemd/system, named either redis.service or mysqI.service (note the spelling of mysql with a capital I) depending on what has been hardcoded into the malware.\"\n\nIn doing so, it allows the malware to give the impression that it's benign and also survive reboots. Two of the commands executed by the botnet are \"xmrig\" and \"networkxm\" indicating that the compromised devices are being used to mine cryptocurrency in an illicit manner.\n\nHowever, the commands are launched without specifying the full paths, an aspect that signals that the payloads are likely downloaded or unpacked elsewhere on the infected host. Darktrace said its analysis of the campaign uncovered other related binaries that are said to be deployed as part of a broader campaign -\n\nGiven that the SSH brute-force capabilities of the botnet malware lends it worm-like capabilities, users are required to keep an eye out for anomalous SSH login activity, particularly failed login attempts, audit systemd services regularly, review authorized_keys files for the presence of unknown SSH keys, apply strict firewall rules to limit exposure, and filter HTTP requests with non-standard headers, such as X-API-KEY: jieruidashabi.\n\n\"The botnet represents a persistent Go-based SSH threat that leverages automation, credential brute-forcing, and native Linux tools to gain and maintain control over compromised systems,\" Darktrace said.\n\n\"By mimicking legitimate binaries (e.g., Redis), abusing systemd for persistence, and embedding fingerprinting logic to avoid detection in honeypots or restricted environments, it demonstrates an intent to evade defenses.\"",

Instead, organizations should rely on context to determine the criticality of these security defects and their impact on their environments.\n\nOx Security said it analyzed the impact of the KEV list on cloud containerized environments and found that 10 of the 25 bugs in KEV that impact cloud native applications (out of 10,000 most common CVEs) do not represent an actual threat to them.\n\nExamining more than 200 separate environments, the report concluded that these 10 vulnerabilities are either technically unexploitable or require specific conditions to exploit in cloud containerized environments (although some of these were detected tens of thousands of times in open source containers).\n\nOf the 10 vulnerabilities, six require Android-specific environments, physical access, or terminal access (albeit two impact all platforms using Linux kernel and can be chained with other flaws), three impact Chrome, and one affects Apple’s Safari browser.\n\nFour of the six Android defects are not exploitable on cloud environments, while the other two require a fix only if local access or internet access is available. The Chrome flaws can be exploited only if the service is used for image, video, or font processing, while the Safari bug can be ignored on non-browser platforms.\n\nAccording to Ox Security, the software defects listed in CISA’s KEV catalog should not be ignored, as they represent significant threats, many impacting cloud environments, and their remediation should remain a high priority. Instead, each CVE should be treated based on its relevancy to the organization.\n\nDefenders should never strip a CVE of its original context but carefully assess the need for patching and its urgency based on the impact it has on their organizations’ environment, as some vulnerabilities could prove entirely harmless, Ox says.\n\nIdentifying the platforms impacted by a CVE, identifying publicly available exploits, understanding how the bug can be exploited in real-world scenarios, assessing its relationship to sensitive information, and understanding the outcome of successful exploitation are essential in determining the impact of a vulnerability.\n\n“This additional contextual information would enable security teams to implement a more precise and efficient workflow when handling critical vulnerabilities in their environments, reducing alert fatigue and focusing resources where they matter most,” the company said.\n\nThe security firm, which breaks down each of these vulnerabilities and explains why they have no or little impact on containerized environments, suggests that platform-specific relevance indicators, CVE origin information, and context on attack paths and attack chains could enhance the KEV catalog.\n\nThe report comes one week after CISA and NIST proposed LEV (Likely Exploited Vulnerabilities), a new cybersecurity metric meant to enhance KEV by assessing the likelihood that a security defect has been exploited in attacks.\n\nRelated: Exploitation Long Known for Most of CISA’s Latest KEV Additions\n\nRelated: Faster Patching Pace Validates CISA’s KEV Catalog Initiative\n\nRelated: EU Cybersecurity Agency ENISA Launches European Vulnerability Database",

        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-28\n\n요약: Security researchers warn that OneDrive’s file sharing tool may grant third-party web apps access to all your files—not just the one you choose to upload.\n\n본문:\nExcessive permissions and ambiguous consent statements may provide web apps uploading files to OneDrive with read access to all user files rather than just those concerned.\n\nThe issue stems from an insufficiently fine-grained OAuth scope for OneDrive. This leads OneDrive’s File Picker to request read access to all the user’s files rather than the file or files currently being uploaded. It is compounded by user consent dialogs that are not as clear as they could be, making it easy for users to click through, unaware of access being granted to a third party app.\n\nThe problem is discussed by Elad Luz, research lead at Oasis Security. “In simple terms,” explains the researcher, “any web application that uses the OneDrive File Picker has access not just to the file you select to upload / download, but to your entire OneDrive. Even worse, this access might persist after the file upload is complete.” It is a classic denial of the least privilege principle.\n\nLud names five widely used web apps that are affected: ChatGPT, Slack, Trello, Zoom and ClickUp, but estimates that hundreds of other apps are affected. Oasis reported its concerns to Microsoft, who “took note of the report and may consider improvements in the future.” However, Lud also notes that other cloud providers use less coarse-grained choices.\n\n“Google Drive,” for example, “offers a fine-grained [OAuth] scope for web applications, allowing them access only to files that the app has created or those that have been explicitly shared with it.”\n\nAnd “Dropbox offers a file picker solution through its Chooser SDK, which does not rely on a typical OAuth flow. Instead, it uses a proprietary endpoint where it passes the app key to retrieve the selected files.” This minimizes the need for broad permissions and avoids unnecessary exposure of user data.\n\nThis is not a bug in Microsoft’s implementation of OAuth, although it could be called a misconfiguration, and it does increase the attack surface. Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, comments: “The read/write scope, together with the consent dialog, do not convey that a click grants the integrator a door into every file and folder in the user’s OneDrive, not just the document they meant to share.”\n\nFurthermore, he continues, “Once issued, those long-lived tokens are often cached in localStorage or back-end DBs without encryption. Therefore, any token theft allows attackers to trawl an entire tenant’s data.”\n\nTo make matters worse, users often fail to recognize how much important data can be held in their OneDrive files. “Scanned documents that end up in the ‘My Pictures’ or ‘My Documents’ folders may hold the key to one’s credit identity and profile. Private medical or banking records may get shuffled in and forgotten about, and private photos that were taken by accident synced from your phone to your computer can all silently file into your One-Drive enabled folders,” adds Jamie Boote, associate principal security consultant at Black Duck.\n\n“Whenever an app asks if you trust it, you’re trusting it with your most precious data.”\n\nJust because it’s Microsoft, we cannot assume it’s safe. “Users should assume that every SaaS plug-in they authorize has the keys to their personal or enterprise crown jewels unless proven otherwise,” says Soroko. “Security teams should enforce ‘admin consent’ or conditional-access policies that block apps requesting anything beyond Files.Read. They should also review existing enterprise app registrations for high risk scopes and disable or re-authorize them with the least privilege alternatives and require short lived bound tokens via Continuous Access Evaluation and token-protection in Entra ID.”\n\nLud’s own conclusion is simple: “A scope that is not fine-grained enough, combined with a vague use prompt, creates a dangerous combination for both personal users and organizations.” The takeaway is simple: Microsoft should tighten its OAuth scope, and ensure its developers never assume that users will always do the right thing.\n\nRelated: Google OAuth Flaw Leads to Account Takeover When Domain Ownership Changes\n\nRelated: Millions of Websites Susceptible to XSS Attack via OAuth Implementation Flaw\n\nRelated: Oasis Security Raises $35 Million to Tackle Non-Human Identity Management\n\nRelated: Microsoft Adds OneDrive to Bug Bounty Program",

Meta started removing some of the malicious ads, domains, and accounts in 2024, before Mandiant notified it of its findings.\n\nMandiant said it identified over 30 different fake websites posing as popular tools such as Luma AI, Canva Dream Lab, and Kling AI, which have been promoted through a network of more than 120 misleading social media ads that reached millions of users, including over 2.3 million in the European Union.\n\nPromising text-to-video or image-to-video generation capabilities, the fake websites would present the same prompt to any visitor, and then serve a ZIP archive that is offered for download once the fake video creation process is supposedly completed.\n\nAccording to Mandiant, the infection chain it observed relies heavily on DLL side-loading, process injection, and in-memory droppers, and uses AutoRun registry keys to achieve persistence.\n\nThe ZIP archive contains a double-extension executable that delivers the Rust-based Starkveil dropper to the victims’ machines. The dropper then executes the Coilhatch launcher, which deploys the XWorm and Frostrift .NET backdoors, along with the .NET downloader Grimpull.\n\nA separate report from Morphisec notes that the malicious AI output served by the fake websites dropped the Noodlophile Stealer, sometimes bundled with the XWorm backdoor.\n\nMandiant observed both XWorm and Frostrift collecting system information, including usernames, OS details, hardware identifiers, and anti-virus details. XWorm can also log keystrokes, while Frostrift checks for certain messaging applications, browsers, and browser extensions.\n\n“As AI has gained tremendous momentum recently, our research highlights some of the ways in which threat actors have taken advantage of it.

        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-28\n\n요약: Physicist Neil Johnson explores how fundamental laws of nature could explain why AI sometimes fails—and what to do about it.\n\n본문:\nNo-one really understands how AI works or when and why it doesn’t. But the application of first-principle physics theory to the working of AI’s Attention mechanism is providing new insights.\n\nNeil Johnson is a Professor of Physics at George Washington University, heading an initiative in ‘complexity and data science’. In April 2025 he (with researcher Frank Yingjie Huo) published a paper (PDF) titled Capturing AI’s Attention: Physics of Repetition, Hallucination, Bias and Beyond.\n\nThat’s techno for ‘why and when does AI provide false predictions, such as hallucinations and biased responses?’\n\nIt’s an important question. Use of AI is increasing rapidly, but understanding AI – even by those who develop it – is not. Usage will pervade every aspect of our lives, from healthcare to warfare; and our lives could depend on something we don’t understand.\n\n“If you ask anyone to explain how gen-AI works, they draw a blank,” says Johnson. “There is ongoing work trying to understand it, but that work is not really progressing.” This leads to an important and fundamental question: How can you make something safe, secure, and efficient – and how can you trust it – if you don’t know how it works?\n\nJohnson’s paper seeks to explain the inner workings of AI to understand its continuing propensity to hallucinate and provide biased outputs. He uses first-principle physics theory (a theoretical framework that explains phenomena based on fundamental laws and principles of nature, such as quantum mechanics) to understand the Attention mechanism – that part of an LLM that allows the model to focus on the relevant parts of an input while generating predictions for its output. It’s the transformer T in GPT, but it exists in all LLMs.\n\nThe math, as you would expect from a professor of Physics, is complex.\n\nHowever, simplistically, the gist associates the decision process in the Attention mechanism to two ‘spin baths’ in physics. A spin is an individual particle, while the bath comprises other particles with which it can interact. In the Attention mechanism, the spin is a token (let’s say a word), and the bath contains other words it could semantically associate with. According to Johnson, the Attention mechanism comprises two spin baths.\n\nContinuing the physics analogy, this allows the Attention mechanism to be seen as a 2-body Hamiltonian (the Hamiltonian is a physics term for the representation of the total energy of a system). The math in the paper then demonstrates that two is not enough, primarily showing that bias (which is almost impossible to objectively exclude) in the training data can affect individual token weights in the spin baths – sometimes giving too much weight to a particular token which can then affect the outcome with biased or hallucinated predictions.\n\n“The theory predicts how a bias (e.g. from pre-training or fine tuning the LLM) can perturb N [the context vector] so that the trained LLM’s output is dominated by inappropriate vs. appropriate content (e.g. ‘bad’ such as “THEY ARE EVIL” vs. ‘good’),” reports the paper. “We’re not making any statements here about training data being right or wrong,” adds Johnson, “we’re just asking, given the training data it is being fed on, do we know when the Attention mechanism is going to go off the rails and give me something completely unreliable?”\n\nIn the 2-body Hamiltonian, this cannot be known. It will happen sooner with an LLM insufficiently trained or trained on biased data; but the potential is always likely to exist in LLMs that equate to 2-body Hamiltonians. And they all do. Johnston believes it is the result of the evolution – almost a Darwinian evolution – of AI through engineers who never really understood how or why AI works. A 2-body Hamiltonian design worked pretty well, so that was adopted.\n\nThis doesn’t mean AI cannot be made better… The quantum analogy continues – a 3-body Hamiltonian would be immensely more powerful (in this case, better and more accurate) than the current 2-body Hamiltonian – just as 3 qubits in quantum is immensely more powerful than 2 classical bits. And why not 4-body, or 5-body Hamiltonians?\n\nWell, you could say the answer lies in Britain’s Gauge Wars. George Stephenson, engineer (‘the Father of the Railways’) settled on a railway gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (the narrow or standard gauge).\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel, perhaps the UK’s greatest ever design engineer, was later tasked with developing a train route from Bristol to London. He chose a railway gauge of 7 feet 0.25 inches (the broad gauge) arguing the result would be faster, smoother and safer travel.\n\nBrunel was right, but Stephenson was already embedded and in widespread use, and the narrow gauge eventually became law by Act of Parliament. The episode highlights two fundamentals of progress: initial investments create inertia if they work (even if they could work better); and changing is costly and disruptive.\n\nThis is exactly where we are now with gen-AI. So many billions of dollars have been invested in its design it is unconscionable to dump everything and start again – especially since it sort of works much of the time, and is very profitable as it is.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that security people are unable to do anything. By lifting the lid and getting a deeper understanding of how the Attention mechanism works, Johnson is able to discuss a risk management approach to a safer use of AI. His math shows a link between poor or inadequate training and unreliable output. From his mathematical understanding of the cause and effect, he can predict performance: he has the technology, or at least a formula on how to predict when a particular LLM is likely to go off the rails. It could be every 200 words in poorly trained LLMs, or every 2,000 words in better trained LLMs.\n\nIt will become a matter of risk management. Just as insurance already relies on the use of actuarial data, so LLM risk will become manageable with AI actuarial data. Right now, it’s early days. There are many different AI models trained on data of varying quality, so there will be many different points at which each will likely go off the rails. But he believes the math has provided a firm path forward.\n\nLearn More at the AI Risk Summit | August 19-20, 2025 – Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay\n\nRelated: The Shadow AI Surge: Study Finds 50% of Workers Use Unapproved AI Tools\n\nRelated: Epic AI Fails And What We Can Learn From Them\n\nRelated: What If the Current AI Hype Is a Dead End?\n\nRelated: Bias in Artificial Intelligence: Can AI be Trusted?",

Combined with flaws in the underlying system or a privileged process, use-after-free issues in Chrome can lead to sandbox escape.\n\nThe latest Chrome update also resolves five medium-severity security defects in the Background Fetch API, FileSystemAccess API, Messages, BFCache, and libvpx, and one low-severity flaw in Tab Strip.\n\nGoogle says it handed out $7,500 in bug bounty rewards to the reporting researchers, but it has yet to determine the amounts to be paid for the high-severity vulnerabilities and two medium-severity bugs, so the final amount could be much higher.\n\nThe latest Chrome iteration is now rolling out as versions 137.0.7151.55/56 for Windows and macOS and as version 137.0.7151.55 for Linux.\n\nFirefox 139 was released with patches for 10 vulnerabilities, including a high-severity double-free issue in libvpx (with no CVE identifier assigned) that could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.\n\nAdditionally, the browser update resolves six medium-severity bugs leading to cross-origin leak attacks, local code execution, cross-site leaks (XS-Leaks), and memory corruption (that could have been exploited for arbitrary code execution).\n\nOn Tuesday, Mozilla also delivered Firefox ESR 128.11 with patches for eight of these vulnerabilities, and Firefox ESR 115.24 with fixes for four of them. Thunderbird 139 was rolled out with fixes for all 10 security defects, while Thunderbird 128.11 came out with patches for eight of the flaws.\n\nWhile Google and Mozilla make no mention of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild, users are advised to update their browsers as soon as possible, as it is not uncommon for threat actors to target Chrome and Firefox bugs.\n\nRelated: Chrome 136 Update Patches Vulnerability With ‘Exploit in the Wild’\n\nRelated: Chrome 136, Firefox 138 Patch High-Severity Vulnerabilities\n\nRelated: Chrome 135, Firefox 137 Updates Patch Severe Vulnerabilities",
